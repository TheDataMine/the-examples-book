= Setting Up Your Account for the Workshop
To get started, you’ll need to set up your ACCESS account. This account will grant you access to Anvil, the powerful computing resource you'll be using for this workshop. It’s important to set up your account before the workshop, as it takes time for you to be added to the allocation.

== Step 1: Create your ACCESS account
*   If you already have an ACCESS account (with your university/work/etc), you do *not* need to do it again. Please go to Step 2.

*   If you forgot your ACCESS username, you can find it here: https://identity.access-ci.org/username-reminder

To create a new account, go to this website: https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user

We suggest you use the https://www.firefox.com[Firefox] browser on a computer for this step.

IMPORTANT: ACCESS have changed their requirements for ACCESS accounts recently. Now, email domains like `gmail.com` and `yahoo.com` are no longer accepted, and your email domain should match the organization you've selected for your ACCESS account. If this is a concern, please reach out at kqlacy(AT)purdue.edu

This video shows you how to create your account.

== Step 2: Share your ACCESS username with us!
Please return to the survey and provide your username so we can add you to our allocation. Missing this step will prevent you from accessing computing resources.

When you try to log into Anvil (https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu/) and receive the 'failed to map' error, it means you haven't been added to our allocation yet. It typically takes 1-2 business days after submitting your survey response for us to process your addition. If a couple of days have passed and you're still seeing this error, please don't hesitate to reach out to kqlacy(AT)purdue.edu 

== Step 3: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Once you're added to the allocation and log into Anvil, you'll likely be prompted to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) with your phone.

. Go to the Anvil login page: https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu
. Click the "Login" button.
. Use your ACCESS username and password.

The website will show you how to set up 2FA with an app on your phone.

The video below shows you the steps to login to DataMine Notebook.

== Step 4: Verify your information on the Hub
Within 1-2 busniess days after your survey submission, you should receive an email invitation (check your spam) from The Data Mine's Hub. If needed, you can resend the invitation to yourself by entering the email here: https://hub.datamine.purdue.edu/

If you don’t have an `.edu` email address, you can ignore the first checkmark on TDMHub. This requirement doesn’t apply to you.

IMPORTANT: If you used a different email to create your ACCESS account, please add this alternate email under the Settings. This will allow us to link your ACCESS and Hub accounts, granting you the access to Anvil. 

== Step 5: You're done!
If you encounter any issues during this process, don't hesitate to reach out to kqlacy(AT)purdue.edu.
