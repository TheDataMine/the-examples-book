== About Structured Query Language (SQL)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database and it provides a relational database management system. SQL allows users to efficiently create, read, update, and delete data in databases. It is widely used across applications, from small projects to large-scale industry systems. For data analysts, data scientists, and software developers, understanding SQL is essential for working effectively with databases.

We use link:https://sqlite.org[SQLite], which does not require a server to run. The database is built into the application, and the app reads from and writes to the database files directly on disk.  SQLite source code is public and free to everyone.

== Datasets

JupyterLab on https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil], a supercomputer supported by the National Science Foundation, will be used for this workshop.



=== IMDb 

We will use the https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/[IMDb] SQLite data located at: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`[1] for all *demo* content. 

The following is an illustration of the database to help you understand the data.

[1] There are 7 data files provided by IMDb:

[source,bash]
----
name.basics.tsv.gz
title.akas.tsv.gz
title.basics.tsv.gz
title.crew.tsv.gz
title.episode.tsv.gz
title.principals.tsv.gz
title.ratings.tsv.gz
----

We will use the SQLite database format created from those tsv (Tab-Separated Values) files.


=== NYC Taxi Cab 

[Warning]
====
Maggie still needs to add content. 

Do we want to use the sample or full amount? 
====

We will use the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission link:www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page[TLC Trip Record Data]. The SQLite database on Anvil is located at `./taxi/taxi.db` [2] for the full data and `./taxi/taxi_sample.db`  for the sample data. 

We will use the taxi cab data for all *practice on your own* content. 

== Login in to Anvil

Let's launch a Jupyter session on Anvil by navigating to https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu[https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu]. 

Use the ACCESS username that you were assigned (when you setup your account) and the ACCESS password that you chose. You will need to authenticate via DUO.
