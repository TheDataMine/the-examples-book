== About Structured Query Language (SQL)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database and it provides a relational database management system. SQL allows users to efficiently create, read, update, and delete data in databases. It is widely used across applications, from small projects to large-scale industry systems. For data analysts, data scientists, and software developers, understanding SQL is essential for working effectively with databases.

We use SQLite, which does not require a server to run. (https://sqlite.org[*]). The database is built into the application, and the app reads from and writes to the database files directly on disk.  SQLite source code is public and free to everyone.
