= WSDS Notes

This page was prepared for the Women in Statistics and Data Science conference, held November 12–14, 2025. You are welcome to use it to practice working with SQLite.

We will use Jupyter Lab notebook on https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil], that is a supercomputer funded by the National Science Foundation. 

== Data Sets: IMDb 

We will use https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/[IMDb] SQLite data located at: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`[1]

The following is an illustration of the database to help you understand the data.

image::figure14.webp[Database diagram from https://dbdiagram.io, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Database diagram from https://dbdiagram.io"]


[1] There are 7 data files provided by IMDb:

[source,bash]
----
name.basics.tsv.gz
title.akas.tsv.gz
title.basics.tsv.gz
title.crew.tsv.gz
title.episode.tsv.gz
title.principals.tsv.gz
title.ratings.tsv.gz
----

We will use the SQLite database format created from those tsv (Tab-Separated Values) files.

== Structured Query Language (SQL)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database. SQL allows users to efficiently create, read, update, and delete data in databases.  

== Basics of Querying

For today's practices, please select the `seminar` kernel. To run SQL queries in a Jupyter Lab notebook, first run the following in a cell at the top of your notebook to establish a connection with the database:

[source, sql]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

[TIP]
====
In sqlite, you can show the tables using the following query:

[source, sql]
----
.tables
----

Unfortunately, sqlite-specific functions can't be run in a Jupyter Lab cell like that. Instead, we need to use a different query as follows:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
----
====

Lets see first five lines of `people` table and `titles`:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 5;

SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

It is a good idea to run this query on each table in the dataset to identify the common keys that can be used to connect the tables in SQL. It is also helpful to limit the number of rows you display, viewing an entire table at once is not practical. For example, let’s check how many records are in the people table:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people;
----

As you can see, there are more than 11 million records, so displaying the full table would not be feasible.

Let’s take a closer look at the titles table by running the following query:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

As you can see, each row includes a `title_id` that corresponds to the title of a movie, TV show, or another type of media. But what exactly is this `title_id`? Take a look at the following link:

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161

At this point, you might guess that this is the ID IMDb uses to identify a movie or TV show. Let’s test that assumption by running a query on our database to find any titles in the `titles` table that match the `title_id` provided in the link above:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE title_id = 'tt0111161';
----

It is The Shawshank Redemption, the top rated movie in IMDb! 

Let's try this one :)

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE title_id = 'tt0108778';
----

You can even find some episodes, when you go to search in https://imdb.com your favorite one which is "the one where Rose pivots" and we see the episode is this one (The one where Ross moves in):

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583486

image::friends-ross.gif[Database diagram from https://tenor.com/search/ross-pivot-gifs, width=292, height=100, loading=lazy]

Let's check if `title_id` also works for `episodes` table, too:


[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM episodes WHERE episodes_title_id = 'tt0108778';
----

No, since it is the title of the show not the title of the episode. Let us change it to `show_title_id`:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM episodes WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778';
----

Of course, if you try `show_title_id` for `tt0111161`, you will not get any result, since it is a movie instead of a show. 

Let's see who was staring in Friends:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778';
----











== Data Sets

Chinook is a SQLite database of digital media store data comes from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranasabrii/chinook

== Description of the Data

The data represents a digital media store with tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers. The updated version of the chinook data is available here (it was slightly updated in 2022):

https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/tree/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources

It has an interesting name. Let’s check the reason behind it on the webpage: "The name of this sample database was based on the Northwind database. Chinooks are winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada. Chinook is a good name choice for a database that intents to be an alternative to Northwind."*

The data is located at: /anvil/projects/tdm/data/chinook/chinook.db

To run SQL queries in a Jupyter Lab notebook, first copy the chinook database to your local storage in anvil so that you are able to modify it:

=== Database Setup
[source,python]
----
import sqlite3

# Load the Chinook database
read_only_chinook = sqlite3.connect('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/chinook/chinook.sqlite')
local_chinook = sqlite3.connect('./chinook.sqlite')

read_only_chinook.backup(local_chinook)
read_only_chinook.close()
local_chinook.close()
----

Before diving deeper into the code, let’s take a moment to talk about Structured Query Language (SQL) — the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL enables users to efficiently create, read, update, and delete data. It is widely used across applications, from small projects to large-scale industry systems. For data analysts, data scientists, and software developers, understanding SQL is essential for working effectively with databases.

Note: The Northwind database is a sample dataset originally developed by Microsoft and has served as the foundation for tutorials across many of their database products for decades.
