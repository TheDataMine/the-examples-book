== Course Description 

Structured Query Language (SQL) remains an essential tool for accessing, manipulating, and analyzing data across a wide range of fields. This session offers a practical, technically grounded introduction to SQL, focusing on writing efficient queries, filtering and aggregating data, and joining multiple tables for exploratory analysis. Participants will work with real-world datasets to apply their skills in context, gaining hands-on experience that supports both immediate application and long-term growth in data-focused roles.
