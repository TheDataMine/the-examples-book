= 4. Joins and other ways to combining or create tables


== Concepts

The `JOIN` command lets us combine data from two or more tables by matching values in a shared column. 

There are 4 primary types of SQL joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

There are several ways of joining tables, we will compare `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`. In SQL, an `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. 

A `LEFT JOIN`, on the other hand, returns all the rows from the left table (the first table in the join) and the matching rows from the right table (the second table in the join). If there is no match, `NULL` values are returned for the columns of the right table.

=== Additional ways to combine or create tables

[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Command | Description | Example | Example Description
| `INTO` | A directional command that may be used to create a new table from the results of a query. | `SELECT * INTO new_table FROM table` | Selects all columns from `table` and creates a new table called `new_table` with the results
| `INSERT` | Used to insert new records into a table. | `INSERT INTO table (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)` | Inserts a new record into the `table` with `column1` set to `value1` and `column2` set to `value2`
| `UPDATE` | Used to modify existing records in a table. | `UPDATE table SET column = value WHERE condition` | Updates the `column` in the `table` to `value` where the `condition` is met
| `DELETE` | Used to delete records from a table. | `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition` | Deletes records from the `table` where the `condition` is met
| `DROP` | Used to delete a table or database. | `DROP TABLE table` | Deletes the `table` from the database
| `CREATE` | Used to create a new table or database. | `CREATE TABLE table (column1 datatype, column2 datatype)` | Creates a new table called `table` with `column1` and `column2` of specified data types

=== Primary and foreign keys

[IMPORTANT]

====

A primary key is a unique identifier for every record in a table. It cannot be left `NULL` and every row for this column must be unique. 

A foreign key is an identifier used to reference a primary key in a different (foreign) table. In other words, a foreign key must exist in another table. 


== Demo

Let us simply `INNER JOIN` two tables first:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew as c INNER JOIN people as p
ON c.person_id = p.person_id LIMIT 5;
----

WE can use the `WHERE` clause and the `IS NULL` operator to list only crew members who do not have a matching record in the `people` table.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew as c LEFT JOIN people as p  
ON c.person_id = p.person_id 
WHERE p.name IS NULL
LIMIT 20;
----

[NOTE]
====
There also exists a `RIGHT JOIN`, which is the opposite of a `LEFT JOIN`, but SQLite does not support it natively. If you need to use a right join, you can typically just use a left join with the order of the tables flipped. Additionally, there is an `OUTER JOIN`, which is a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. It returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs in places where there is no match. However, SQLite does not support FULL OUTER JOIN natively either.

=== Join three tables

Let us see all the movies Christopher Nolan worked on:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew 
INNER JOIN people ON crew.person_id = people.person_id
INNER JOIN titles ON crew.title_id = titles.title_id
WHERE people.name = 'Christopher Nolan' AND titles.type = 'movie';
----

We can order them by premiered year:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew 
INNER JOIN people ON crew.person_id = people.person_id
INNER JOIN titles ON crew.title_id = titles.title_id
WHERE people.name = 'Christopher Nolan' AND titles.type = 'movie'
ORDER BY titles.premiered;
----

Now, we want to see what type of productions (movies, video, etc.) Christopher Nolan is mainly working on (executing this code will take some time):

[source, sql]
----
SELECT t.type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM titles AS t
JOIN crew AS c ON t.title_id = c.title_id
JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id
WHERE p.name = 'Christopher Nolan' 
GROUP BY t.type
ORDER BY count DESC;
----

We can see find what type of movies Christopher Nolan is mainly working on:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT t.genres, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM titles AS t
JOIN crew AS c ON t.title_id = c.title_id
JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id
WHERE p.name = 'Christopher Nolan' AND t.type = 'movie'
GROUP BY t.genres
ORDER BY count DESC;
----

== Practice on your own 


.Deliverables
====

4.1. Look at first 5 records in at least 3 tables in the Lahman dataset, not including the People table.

4.2. Name any columns that appear in multiple tables, or only in a specific table.

4.3. Describe how the tables might relate to each other.

4.4 Write a SQL query to join the People and Salaries tables using the playerID column, and limit the results to the first 5 records.

4.5. Write a SQL query to join the People and Salaries tables, and return the average salary of players grouped by their weight, sorted in descending order, limiting the results to 10 records.

4.6. WriteJOIN command to combine the `Batting` table with the `People` table. Answer the next questions with this info. 

4.7. Write a SQL query to find how many times Babe Ruth reached the home plate.

4.8. Write a SQL query to find the average number of points scored by players born in the 1980s, grouped and ordered by their birth year.

4.9. Query to find the 10 highest scoring players and their names.

4.10. Query to find the 10 highest hitting players and their names.

4.11. Are there any players who appear in both lists? If so, who are they?
