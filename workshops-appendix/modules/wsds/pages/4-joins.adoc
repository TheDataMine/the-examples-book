= 4. Joins: Combining Tables


== Concepts

Primary key / foreign key. 

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN. 

Why/when we join tables. 

The `JOIN` command lets us combine data from two or more tables by matching values in a shared column. There are several ways of joining tables, we will compare `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`.
In SQL, an `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. For example, if we join the `crew` table with the `people` table using an `INNER JOIN`, we will only get the rows where there is a matching person_id in both tables.

A `LEFT JOIN`, on the other hand, returns all the rows from the left table (the first table in the join) and the matching rows from the right table (the second table in the join). If there is no match, `NULL` values are returned for the columns of the right table. This means that if we join the `crew` table with the `people` table using a `LEFT JOIN`, we will get all the rows from the `crew` table, even if there is no matching `person_id` in the `people` table.


== Demo

Let us simply `INNER JOIN` two tables first:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew as c INNER JOIN people as p
ON c.person_id = p.person_id LIMIT 5;
----

WE can use the `WHERE` clause and the `IS NULL` operator to list only crew members who do not have a matching record in the `people` table.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM crew as c LEFT JOIN people as p  
ON c.person_id = p.person_id 
WHERE p.name IS NULL
LIMIT 20;
----

Lets assume that you want to see what type of movies Christopher Nolan is mainly working on:

So, you need the following information: name of the director, movies he  and genre
