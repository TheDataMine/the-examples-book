= 6. Real-World Querying Challenge

We encourage you to take what you've learned today and continue practicing with the below SQL databases throughout the remainder of the conference. Maggie and Fulya will be present at the conference through Friday if you have questions. 

We will remove users from Anvil on Monday so please be sure to download any notes, documents, or files by then.
