Please use `seminar-r` for this part. The following library used to call SQL queries in R:

[source, r]
====
library(sqldf)
====

There is only one function we need to focus on: `sqldf`. This function executes a given SQL query, such as:

[source, r]
====
SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
====

[NOTE]
====
For the ease of reading, please write SQL syntax in all UPPER CASE and variable names/database names in lower case. Actually, SQL syntax is NOT case sensitive. However, remember that R is case sensitive, so please be careful with the capitalization of data frame and variable names.
