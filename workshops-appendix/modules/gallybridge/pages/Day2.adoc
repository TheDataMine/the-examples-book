== Introduction

Now that we know where the victim was found let's see if we can use weather data to learn anything more. 

Today's session is all about exploratory data analysis or EDA. 

== Getting Weather Data

The first challenge we have is finding a place to get data. There are lots of organizations that make data available to anyone who is interested. This is called open-source data. 

In coding languages, like Python, there are also packages that we can use. Packages group useful code together for easy use. 

In this case we can use the https://github.com/meteostat/meteostat-python[meteostat Python package] to get open-source weather data. 

== Practice Exercises

Before we run anything we need to import the packages for use in Python. The code below only needs to be run once and it will make the packages available for us to use. 

[source, python]
----
from meteostat import Point, Daily, Stations
from datetime import datetime

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
----

. Now that we have them imported how do we get data for our location? We know the victim was found in the Memorial Mall.

Reading through the https://dev.meteostat.net/python/point.html#example[meteostat documents] we find that if we pass it a latitude and longitude we can get weather data.

We can use a https://dev.meteostat.net/python/api/stations/nearby.html[similar function] to check for any weather stations that are near a point. 

We can use https://www.google.com/maps[Google maps] to find our latitude and longitude and then use the function to see if any weather data is available. 

[source, python]
----
# Define our point of interest (location). 
latitude = 38.889478
longitude = -77.036111

# Set a date range for our data. 
start_date = datetime(2022, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(2022, 6, 8) 

stations = Stations()
stations = stations.nearby(latitude, longitude)

station_info = stations.fetch(1).reset_index()
print(station_info)

. The fun part of EDA is that the process evolves as you learn more about the data. Looking at the data above we see a `distance` of 4,396. That seems far. We may want to know how long that is.

====
Looking through the https://dev.meteostat.net/python/api/stations/nearby.html[meteostat documentation] we can see that the `distance` value is returned in meters. 

Using Google, we can find that 1 mile is roughly `0.000621371` meters. 

[source, python]
----
# How far away is the station?
meters_to_miles = 0.000621371

# Rounding mapes it a bit easier to read. 
meters = np.round(station_info['distance'][0], 2)
miles = np.round(meters * meters_to_miles, 2)

print("The weather station is {} meters or {} miles away from our point of interest.".format(meters, miles))
----

----
The weather station is 4396.49 meters or 2.73 miles away from our point of interest.
----
====
+
. That doesn't seem too bad! Now that we know we have a weather station near our area we can pull the data.

We can use the `id` from our output previously to get data for the specific station. 

[source, python]
----
data = Daily("72405", start_date, end_date)
data = data.fetch().reset_index()

# This is a check we can add to make sure we are getting data. 
if len(data) == 0:
    print("No data found.")
else:
    print("Good to go!")

Most often when working on EDA it helps to print the data's columns. 

You can also check the https://dev.meteostat.net/python/daily.html#data-structure[meteostat documentation] to learn more about the data we get back. 

[source, python]
----
print(data.columns)
----

----
Index(['time', 'tavg', 'tmin', 'tmax', 'prcp', 'snow', 'wdir', 'wspd', 'wpgt',
       'pres', 'tsun'],
      dtype='object')

After checking the columns, we can also print the first few rows of the data to see what it looks like. 

[source, python]
----
print(data.head())

Are there any other data checks that you would do?

Now that we have the data can we narrow down the timeframe for the murder?
+
What do we know so far?
+
* The victim showed signs of being in water, but not submerged. 
* The victim was sunburned. 
* The victim was found under a large amount of tree debris. 
+
Using these items letâ€™s see if we can find interesting weather conditions. 
+
. We can start by looking at how wet it was.

This is good to know, but it would probably be better to look at precipitation over time. 

One of the ways we can do that is visually. 

[source, python]
----
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(15,8))

ax1.scatter(data['time'], data['prcp'], c='blue', alpha=0.25)
ax1.plot(data['time'], data['prcp'], c='blue', linestyle='--')

plt.title('Rain Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Precip')

plt.close('all')

. We can check the `tsun` variable to see if it's an issue with the data or with our code.

print(data['tsun'].max())

nan
----
====
+
When we see `nan` as the max value it means that Python couldn't find any number values. 
+
You can think of `nan` like `Null` or missing values. 
+
This happens *all the time* during EDA. Data is messy and we often don't have the values that we would like. 
+
. Now that we know we don't have sun data we can check wind to see what we find.

This is interesting to look at but is a bit hard to read. The wind data is noisy and has lots of peaks and valleys. 
+
Often, it's helpful to aggregate the data in some way to look at trends over time. 
+
In this case, we can make some assumptions:
+
* The coroner mentioned that the victim looked like they were partially in water for 3 or more days. 
* The victim was found under a broken branch. This would require a high wind speed. 
+
. Instead of looking at the raw precipitation data what if we look at an average over 3 days.
