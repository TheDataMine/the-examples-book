= Plotting in R with `graphics`

== Introduction

The `graphics` package is included with the language, meaning you won't need to import anything at the beginning of your file. It includes a ton of useful, variably-complex plots to use on your journey of data visualization.

=== Examples

==== Use the sapply function to run this function on each election year (in other words, the even numbered years) from 1980 to 2018 to obtain the total amount of the donations from Indiana during federal election campaigns. Plot amount of money donated from Indiana per election cycle from 1980 to 2018.

==== Use the sapply function to run this function on each election year (in other words, the even numbered years) from 1980 to 2018 to get the total amount of all the donations from all of the states during an election year. Use the tapply function to add up the amount of donations in each state, across all of the years. Plot the amount of money donated from each of the top 10 states altogether during 1980 to 2018.
