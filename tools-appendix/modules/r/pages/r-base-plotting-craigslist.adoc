= Plotting in R with `graphics`

== Introduction

The `graphics` package is included with the language, meaning you won't need to import anything at the beginning of your file. It includes a ton of useful, variably-complex plots to use on your journey of data visualization.

=== Examples

==== Show the map with the Craiglist data from Indiana. (Some of the data points will be outside Indiana, but most of them will be in the State of Indiana.)
