= Apply Functions

== `tapply`

The https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/tapply[documentation definition] for `tapply` is a bit more specific than the others, where the arguments are now `(X, INDEX, FUN)`, with `X` being an object where the `split` function applies, `INDEX` is a factor by which `X` is grouped, and `FUN` is function as before.

To simplify this definition, we can say `tapply` applies `FUN` to `X` when `X` is grouped by `INDEX`.
