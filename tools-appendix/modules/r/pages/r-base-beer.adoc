= R `base` functions

== subset
`subset`  is a function that helps you take subsets of data. By default, `subset` removes NA rows.

NOTE: `subset` does not perform any operation that can't be accomplished by indexing.

=== Examples

==== Using the reviews_sample csv file, make a subset of the beers that have (score != 5) & (overall == 5) (in other words the score value is not equal to 5 but the overall value is equal to 5).

== nrow
`nrow` is a function that returns the number of rows of a matrix, vector, array or data.frame.

=== Examples

==== Using the reviews_sample csv file, how many lines of data are in the subset that has (score != 5) & (overall == 5)?
