== table

`table` is a function used to build a contingency table, which is a table that shows counts for categorical data, from one or more categories. `prop.table` is a function that accepts `table` output, returning proportions of the counts.

=== Examples

==== In the DeathRecords data file, create a table of the values in the Race column and how many times that each Race value occurs.

The labels for part a should be the default labels, i.e., like this: (-Inf,18] (18,25] (25,35] (35,55] (55,150] (150, Inf]

    "middle age adult": older than 35 but less than or equal to 55 years old

    "senior adult": greater than 55 years old but less than or equal to 150 years old (or any other upper threshold that you like)

    "unknown": age of 999 (you could use, say, ages 150 to Inf for this category)

== cut
`cut` breaks a vector into factors specified by the argument `breaks`. `cut` is particularly useful to break Date data into quarters (Q1, Q2), years (1999, 2000, 2001), and so on.

=== Examples

==== Use the cut command to classify people at their time of death into 6 categories:

[NOTE]
====
    "youth": less than or equal to 18 years old

    "young adult": older than 18 but less than or equal to 25 years old

    "adult": older than 25 but less than or equal to 35 years old

    "middle age adult": older than 35 but less than or equal to 55 years old

    "senior adult": greater than 55 years old but less than or equal to 150 years old (or any other upper threshold that you like)

    "unknown": age of 999 (you could use, say, ages 150 to Inf for this category)

== subset
`subset`  is a function that helps you take subsets of data. By default, `subset` removes NA rows.

NOTE: `subset` does not perform any operation that can't be accomplished by indexing.

=== Examples

==== In the DeathRecords data file, show the head of the subset of data for which Sex=='F'.
