= Plotting in R with `graphics`

== Introduction

The `graphics` package is included with the language, meaning you won't need to import anything at the beginning of your file. It includes a ton of useful, variably-complex plots to use on your journey of data visualization.

=== Examples

==== Use the sapply function to run this function on each year from 1987 to 2008. Then, plot the total number of flights starting from the Indianapolis airport during 1987 to 2008.
[source,R]

myindyflights <- function(myyear) {
    myDF <- fread(paste0("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/", myyear, ".csv"))
    myvalue <- table(myDF$Origin)['IND']
    names(myvalue) <- myyear
    return(myvalue)
}
