= R `base` functions


== subset
`subset`  is a function that helps you take subsets of data. By default, `subset` removes NA rows.

NOTE: `subset` does not perform any operation that can't be accomplished by indexing.

=== Examples

==== Using the Craigslist vehicles file, read ALL of the rows of the data set into a new data frame, but only the three columns called state and long and lat (the other columns will not be needed). Create a subset of this new data frame, satisfying 3 conditions, namely, the state variable indicates that the data is from Indiana, and the long and lat values are not missing.
