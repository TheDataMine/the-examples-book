= bash Overview

== grep
The `grep` utility is used for searching for regular expressions in files.  There are many variants of the `grep` command.

=== Examples

==== Use the `grep` command to extract all of the lines from this file (`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv`) that contain the word terrific and store these reviews in a new file called `terrificreviews.csv` in your home directory.

== cut
We can use `cut` to extract information from a text file.  We usually just need to specify the delimited between the fields of data, using the `-d` option, and we also need to specify the fields to extract, using the `-f` option.  For example, we can display the city and state of the donations to federal election campaigns.

=== Examples

==== From the file `terrificreviews.csv` that you created in the previous example, how many of the reviews had only 1 star? How many had 4 stars? How many had 5 stars?
