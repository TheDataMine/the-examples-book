:page-description: How to set up your ACCESS account, join The Data Mine Hub, enable 2FA, and start working on Anvil.

Welcome to The Data Mine! To get started, you will set up a few accounts that give you access to **Anvil**, the powerful computer used for your projects.

Please follow these four steps carefully. If you have trouble at any point, jump to the **Help** section at the bottom of this page.

By completing this setup, you will be able to:

* Log in to Anvil using your ACCESS ID.
* Connect your ACCESS account to The Data Mine Hub (TDM Hub).
* Set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for security.
* Launch a Datamine Notebook session on Anvil.

== Step 1: Create an ACCESS Account

First, you need an account with **ACCESS**. ACCESS manages the Anvil computing system.

* If you created an ACCESS account last year, you do **not** need to do it again. Go to *Step 2*.
* If you forgot your ACCESS username, you can find it here: https://identity.access-ci.org/username-reminder
* To create a new account, go to: https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user

Dr. Ward recommends using the **Firefox** browser on a computer for this step.  
A video guide is available on the setup page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you create your ACCESS account, The Data Mine team will use this information to grant you access to our systems.  
Make sure you remember your ACCESS username and password — you’ll use them to log in to Anvil.
====

== Step 2: Join The Data Mine Hub (TDM Hub)

Next, you’ll connect your ACCESS account to **The Data Mine** through the **TDM Hub**.

. **Wait for an Invitation Email**  
Look for an email from `no-reply@purdue.edu` with the subject **"Invitation to The Data Mine Hub"**.  
This message contains a special link to join.

. **Didn’t receive the email?**  
* Check your **spam** or **junk** folder.  


If you still don’t receive it:  
* Purdue users can submit a ticket using the **“The Data Mine Request”** button on our https://service.purdue.edu/TDClient/32/Purdue/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=2PmJrZczzq4_&RequestorType=ServiceOffering&SIDs=35[Services page].  
* Non-Purdue users can email **datamine-help@purdue.edu** with a short description of the problem and what you’ve tried.

. **Accept the Invitation**  
Click the link in the email and select **Accept Invitation**.

. **Log In to the Hub**  
You’ll receive a second email with a login link — no password required.

. **Complete Your Checklist**  
Inside the Hub, complete each item in the checklist until it turns green.  
This ensures The Data Mine has all the information needed to provision your Anvil access.

[TIP]
====
The TDM Hub updates automatically as you complete each checklist item.

== Step 3: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

To keep your account secure, set up **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.

. Go to https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu
. Click **Login**.
. Enter your **ACCESS username** and **password** (not your Purdue credentials).
. Follow the instructions to set up 2FA using an app on your phone.

This process adds an extra layer of security when logging in to Anvil.

== Step 4: Log In to Anvil and Start a Server

After setting up 2FA, you’re ready to log in to **Anvil**.

. Visit https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu  
. Log in using your ACCESS credentials.  
. When prompted for **Server Options**, choose **Datamine Notebook**.

A screenshot example can be found in *The Examples Book* showing the correct server option.

[TIP]
====
You will use your **laptop or desktop** to connect to Anvil.  
Tablets (like iPads or Galaxy Tabs) are **not recommended** for this setup.
