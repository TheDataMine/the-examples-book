== Welcome To The Data Mine!
.Welcome Message
[%collapsible]
====
Welcome! We are super excited to have you here with us!

– When Professor Mark Daniel Ward launched Purdue University’s Data Mine initiative in 2018, he worked with less than 100 students from various academic backgrounds who wanted to learn about data science and how to apply it in their careers.

- Fast forward to today. Dr. Ward, an esteemed professor of statistics and the director of The Data Mine, is coordinating real-world projects with 26 companies in Indiana and beyond. He’s offering data science training to 600 Purdue undergraduate and graduate students this year, with plans to reach more than 1,000 students in the year ahead.

- And he’s not stopping there. Next up is an Indiana statewide expansion, engaging leading industries and high school students.

== Ways Students Can Partipate In The Data Mine Outside of Purdue:

One of the core ideas behind the Purdue Data Mine is inclusivity and there are a couple of ways in which students can partipate in the Data Mine without attending Purdue University. 

The https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine] is providing opportuntieis for students to learn data science and acquire real-world skills and experience through partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions(MSI) and small/mid -sized schools. 

The https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine] currently operates 2 projects through grant-funded initiatives: 

- National Data Mine Network(NDMMN)
- Indiana Data Mine(IDMM) 

== The Purdue National Data Mine Network (NDMN):
.Details about the National Data Mine Network:
[%collapsible]
====
- The National Data Mine Network(NDMN) is an
NSF funded grant in collaboration with the link:https://www.amstat.org/[American Statistical Assocation] to enable undergraduate students at MSIs to learn data science with hands-on work in research or data science projects by industry partners
- This program will provide a total of $4500 in monthly research stipends ($500/month) plus up to $500 towards conference travel to 100 students (per year) at Minority Serving Institutions
- Students will be able to work on data science projects throughout the 9-month academic year (August through April) and will have access to data science training, materials, and high-performance computing from Purdue University
- In addition to learning data science skills, the students will be able to work on projects with a research mentor or with a mentor from industry through our Data Mine Corporate Partners Projects – we currently have 70+ Corporate Partners projects this year and plan to expand for the upcoming academic year
- Students chosen to participate in the grant activities will receive their research stipends directly from the American Statistical Association.  (Faculty participation in this grant is completely free for those at MSIs.)
====
.Criteria for students eligble for NDMN:
[%collapsible]
====
- Need to be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or permanent resident of the U.S.

- Have undergraduate status at any Minority Serving Institution(MSIs), including Historically Black Colleges(HBCUs) and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, and Universities, or also colleges serving Blind or Deaf learners. 

- A list of many MSIs is given here: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html  (but please inquire if there is any doubt about such classifications or eligibility)

.Role of Faculty Members:
[%collapsible]
====
- Onsite, to help provide mentoring for the students -- Such faculty do not need to have data science experience to mentor a team but should have an interest in working closely with students on a data science project
- Participating faculty will have access to a rich collection of resources and faculty development opportunities
  
All questions are welcome! For questions about this opportunity, please reply to:  datamine@purdue.edu

== The Purdue Indiana Data Mine Network (IDMN)
.Details about the Indiana Data Mine Network:
[%collapsible]
====
- Thanks to a $10 million grant to the Purdue Research Foundation the from Lilly Endowment Inc's Charting the Future for Indiana’s Colleges and Universities initiative, Purdue will launch The Indiana Data Mine, an initiative that will take the Data Mine concept beyond the Purdue West Lafayette campus. 

- Students involved with The Indiana Data Mine will learn data science skills through immersive engagement with Indiana-based companies that will potentially lead to careers in Indiana, enhancing the state’s surging tech sector. 

- That growth is fueled by an explosion of data in the world, with industries ranging from medical to professional sports wanting to know how to interpret that information.

## The Data Mine
https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine] is a data science focused experiential learning project here at Purdue University. We accept students of all undergraduate years and majors, and pair them with corporations. 

Using industry data, The Data Mine encourages collaborative learning amongst our students and to help devise solutions for whatever project or question the industry partner presents.
