<button class="accordion">About The Data Mine</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><a href="https://datamine.purdue.edu/">The Data Mine</a> is a data science-focused experiential learning project here at Purdue University. We accept students of all undergraduate years and majors, and pair them with corporations on an industry project.</p>
  <p>Using industry data, The Data Mine encourages collaborative learning amongst our students and helps devise solutions for whatever project or question the industry partner presents.</p>

<button class="accordion">How We Started</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When Dr. Mark Daniel Ward launched Purdue University’s Data Mine initiative in 2018, he worked with less than 100 students from various academic backgrounds who wanted to learn about data science and how to apply it in their careers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast forward to today. Dr. Ward, an esteemed professor of statistics and the director of The Data Mine, is coordinating real-world projects with many companies in Indiana and beyond.</li> 
    <li>He’s offering data science training to 600 Purdue undergraduate and graduate students this year, with plans to reach more than 1,000 students in the year ahead.</li>
    <li>And he’s not stopping there. Next up for the <a href="https://datamine.purdue.edu/">The Data Mine</a> is an Indiana statewide and Nationwide expansion, engaging leading industries and high school students.</li>

== How To Participate:

One of the core ideas behind the Purdue Data Mine is 'Data Science For All'. 

What this means is that we want people from diverse disciplines and backgrounds to be able to learn, apply and benefit from Data Science skills and knowledge.

<button class="accordion">Details about the National Data Mine Network</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ul>
    <li>The National Data Mine Network(NDMN) is an NSF funded grant in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/">American Statistical Association</a> to enable undergraduate students at MSIs to learn data science with industry work in research or data science projects by industry partners</li>
    <li>This program will provide a total of $4500 in monthly research stipends ($500/month) plus up to $500 towards conference travel to 100 students (per year) at Minority Serving Institutions</li>
    <li>Students will be able to work on data science projects throughout the 9-month academic year (August through April) and will have access to data science training, materials, and high-performance computing from Purdue University</li>
    <li>In addition to learning data science skills, the students will be able to work on projects with a research mentor or with a mentor from industry through our Data Mine Corporate Partners Projects – we currently have 70+ Corporate Partners projects this year and plan to expand for the upcoming academic year</li>
    <li>Students chosen to participate in the grant activities will receive their research stipends directly from the American Statistical Association. (Faculty participation in this grant is completely free for those at MSIs.)</li>
