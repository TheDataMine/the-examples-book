- Students will be able to work on data science projects throughout the 9-month academic year (August through April) and will have access to data science training, materials, and high-performance computing from Purdue University
- In addition to learning data science skills, the students will be able to work on projects with a research mentor or with a mentor from industry through our Data Mine Corporate Partners Projects – we currently have 70+ Corporate Partners projects this year and plan to expand for the upcoming academic year
