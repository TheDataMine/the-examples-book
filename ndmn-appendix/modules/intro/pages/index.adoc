<button class="accordion">About The Data Mine</button>
<div class="panel">
  <li>
    <a href="https://datamine.purdue.edu/" target="_blank" >The Data Mine</a> 
    is a learning and research-based community at Purdue University created to introduce students to data science concepts and equip them to create solutions to real-world problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Data Mine is open to students from any major of study. Students will learn some of the skills most sought after by companies and graduate programs. 
  </li>
  <li>
    No computational background is required. The key trait for joining The Data Mine is the desire to learn data science in a rigorous, but welcoming environment.
  </li>

  <li>
    Using industry data, The Data Mine encourages collaborative learning amongst our students and helps devise solutions for whatever project or question the industry partner presents.

<button class="accordion">How We Started</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When Dr. Mark Daniel Ward launched Purdue Universityâ€™s Data Mine initiative in 2018, he worked with less than 100 students from various academic backgrounds who wanted to learn about data science and how to apply it in their careers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast forward to today, Dr. Ward, The Executive Director of The Data Mine, is coordinating real-world projects with many companies in Indiana and beyond.</li> 
    <li>He is currently offering data science training to over 1700 Purdue undergraduate and graduate students this year, with plans to reach more than 2,200 students in the year ahead.</li>

=== A Message From Dr. Ward

[quote, Dr. Mark Daniel Ward, The Executive Director of The Data Mine]
____
"We endeavor to expand this model to many more companies and a similarly broad range of college and university profiles. I firmly believe in the value of students learning how to work not only on statistical modeling but also on cloud computing, full stack development, containerized environments, digital twins, large language models, and predictive analytics. Moreover, I love for students to learn directly from domain experts about how data science concepts are used in practice".

== How To Participate:

The mission of The Data Mine is to foster, implement, and maintain data-driven collaborations across academic and corporate sectors. By building enduring communities of diverse individuals, our aim is to ensure that data science experiences are accessible and beneficial to everyone.

What this means is that we want people from diverse disciplines and backgrounds to be able to learn, apply, and benefit from data science skills and knowledge.
