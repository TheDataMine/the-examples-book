<button class="accordion">About The Data Mine</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><a href="https://datamine.purdue.edu/">The Data Mine</a> is a data science-focused experiential learning project here at Purdue University. We accept students of all undergraduate years and majors, and pair them with corporations on an industry project.</p>
  <p>Using industry data, The Data Mine encourages collaborative learning amongst our students and helps devise solutions for whatever project or question the industry partner presents.</p>

<button class="accordion">How We Started</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When Dr. Mark Daniel Ward launched Purdue University’s Data Mine initiative in 2018, he worked with less than 100 students from various academic backgrounds who wanted to learn about data science and how to apply it in their careers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast forward to today. Dr. Ward, an esteemed professor of statistics and the director of The Data Mine, is coordinating real-world projects with many companies in Indiana and beyond.</li> 
    <li>He’s offering data science training to 600 Purdue undergraduate and graduate students this year, with plans to reach more than 1,000 students in the year ahead.</li>
    <li>And he’s not stopping there. Next up for the <a href="https://datamine.purdue.edu/">The Data Mine</a> is an Indiana statewide and Nationwide expansion, engaging leading industries and high school students.</li>

== How To Participate:

One of the core ideas behind the Purdue Data Mine is 'Data Science For All'. 

What this means is that we want people from diverse disciplines and backgrounds to be able to learn, apply and benefit from Data Science skills and knowledge.

<button class="accordion">Details about the National Data Mine Network</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ul>
    <li>An NSF-funded grant in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/">American Statistical Association</a> to enable MSIs' undergraduates to learn data science through research or industry projects.</li>
    <li>Provides $4500 in monthly research stipends ($500/month) plus up to $500 for conference travel to 100 students annually.</li>
    <li>Projects run throughout the 9-month academic year (August-April) with access to training, materials, and high-performance computing from Purdue.</li>
    <li>Students work on projects with research mentors or industry partners through the Data Mine Corporate Partners Projects. Currently, there are 70+ corporate partner projects with plans to expand.</li>
    <li>Research stipends are provided directly by the American Statistical Association. (Faculty participation is free for those at MSIs.)</li>
