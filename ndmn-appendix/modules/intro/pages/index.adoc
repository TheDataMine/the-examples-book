== Details about the National Data Mine Network:
- This program will provide a total of $4500 in monthly research stipends ($500/month) plus up to $500 towards conference travel to 100 students (per year) at Minority Serving Institutions
- Students will be able to work on data science projects throughout the 9-month academic year (August through April) and will have access to data science training, materials, and high-performance computing from Purdue University
- In addition to learning data science skills, the students will be able to work on projects with a research mentor or with a mentor from industry through our Data Mine Corporate Partners Projects – we currently have 70+ Corporate Partners projects this year and plan to expand for the upcoming academic year
- Students chosen to participate in the grant activities will receive their research stipends directly from the American Statistical Association.  (Faculty participation in this grant is completely free for those at MSIs.)

== Role of faculty members:
- Onsite, to help provide mentoring for the students -- Such faculty do not need to have data science experience to mentor a team but should have an interest in working closely with students on a data science project
- Participating faculty will have access to a rich collection of resources and faculty development opportunities

## The Data Mine
https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine] is a data science focused experiential learning project here at Purdue University. We accept students of all undergraduate years and majors, and pair them with corporations. 

Using industry data, The Data Mine encourages collaborative learning amongst our students and to help devise solutions for whatever project or question the industry partner presents.
