= Serialization & Deserialization

This topic covers serialization & deserialization -- the former is the process of taking a set or subset of data and transforming it into a specific file format that is designed for transmission over a network, storage, or some other specific use-case; the latter is the opposite process from serialization where the serialized data is reverted back into its original form.
