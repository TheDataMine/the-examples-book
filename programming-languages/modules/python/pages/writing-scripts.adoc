= Writing Scripts

A script is a file containing a sequence of commands to be executedIn Python, this is just a simple `.py` file: `my_script.py`, `hello_world.py`, and so on. For our purposes, Python scripts will be run in a shell.

Before we begin, there's important clarification around the terms script, module, package, and library.

The two lowest levels are *scripts* and *modules*. They may appear similar, but generally speaking, scripts are meant to _do_ something, while modules can just have methods and variables that can be imported to other files. If we are executing a `.py` file directly, we classify that as a script; otherwise, it is a module.

*Packages* are collections of modules that fulfill similar purposes. They contain an `\\__init__.py` file to distinguish packages from general files containing modules. You can access sub-packages with the "." structure, as in `xml.etree`. The `\\__init__.py` structure prevents importing from lower-level packages, so modules must be acquired from 

*Libraries* are similar in structure to packages, and the two are often used interchangeably. A frequent generalization is that libraries are collections of packages, which are themselves collections of modules. 

Don't worry if this is confusing -- the differentiation is primarily for file systems, as Python classifies modules, packages, and libraries all as `module` type. Your main takeaway should be that *libraries are meant to be imported for their contents, while scripts are meant to be run directly*.

== Shells & shebangs

As a brief review, shells are run in a terminal (also called a command line) that connects the user to their files without a GUI. Terminals use UNIX as a programming language, and the shell enables you to interact with UNIX. While imperative for _executing_ scripts, understanding shells isn't required to _write_ your scripts.

Shebangs are typically the first line in your script. It takes the form `#!/bin/bash`, and indicates the interpreter used for executing the script. `bash` is the default shell used by most terminals.

Without a shebang in your script, you would execute your file in a command line as follows:

[source,UNIX]
----
python ~/my_script.py
----

If we didn't use the `python` keyword, the operating system would try to execute the script using various shells; this would inevitably fail, as (if you recall) shells are UNIX-based, and Python is not UNIX.

Shebangs are useful because they remove the need for `python` or `python3` at the start of a command when executing a script, automatically using the interpreter indicated by the shebang.

The standard Python script shebangs are:

* `#!/usr/bin/python`
* `#!/usr/bin/env python`

The first will use the system default Python interpreter located at `/usr/bin/python`. The second is whatever interpreter is used if you just type `python`. Importantly, you can activate your own interpreter and environment with a virtual environment or custom conda, then choose them using the `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang.

=== Package-proofing

When you want a script to run with a certain set of Python packages present in a given environment, it may not be convenient for you to run a command like `conda activate my_environment` prior to executing the script, especially if you have many packages. In these situations, you can simply use your shebang to point to the interpreter associated with `my_environment`. 

For example, the interpreter used with our Fall 2020 semester environment is at `/class/datamine/apps/python/f2020-s2021/env/bin/python`. If we wanted our script to run using all of the packages we've installed into our environment, we can simply use this shebang: `#!/class/datamine/apps/python/f2020-s2021/env/bin/python`.

== Arguments

Arguments are the values passed to the script. For example, in the following command, `-i`, `special word`, and `my_file.txt` are arguments being passed to the function `grep`.

[source,UNIX]
----
grep -i 'special word' my_file.txt
----

This same structure can be applied to Python scripts:

[source,UNIX]
----
$HOME/my_script.py -i 'okay, sounds good!'
----

The acceptance of arguments in the command line depends on how you write your script. To access and utilize arguments in your Python script, you can use the `sys` package. For example, take the following script:

[source,UNIX]
----
import sys

def main():
    print(sys.argv)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
----

We can then run our example execution from before and get output:

[source,UNIX]
----
$HOME/my_script.py -i 'okay, sounds good!'
----
----
['$HOME/my_script.py', '-i', 'okay, sounds good!']
----

Evidently, `sys.argv` returns a list of arguments, and because it's a list, you can index for the n-th argument using `sys.argv[n]`. Keep in mind that `sys.argv[0]` is simply the script name.

As mentioned, the functionality of arguments depends heavily on how you write your script and order your arguments. If we were to write our `grep` example in a different order:

[source,UNIX]
----
grep my_file.txt 'my_pattern'
----

This execution would fail because `grep` requires pattern before file. Programming your own script is much easier when you enforce the position of your arguments.

=== Options/Flags

Arguments can also be optional, those of which are often called flags or options. Most flags have both a short form beginning with "-" and a long form beginning with "--" (`-i` is short for `--ignore-case`). Options have default TRUE value when included, FALSE when not included, and some can have further, non-boolean values.

Another difference between the forms is space. When using short form, the value for the option is separated by a space (`grep -f my_file.txt`), while long form separates the value with an equals sign (`grep --file=my_file.txt`).
