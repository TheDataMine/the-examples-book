= Indentation in Python 

== Overview

Unlike many other programming languages Python will pay attention to the way the code is indented. For comparison a code statement in R is defined by curly braces. For example, in the R code below the braces indicate the bounds of the if statement:

[source, r]
----
my_val <- TRUE
if (my_val) {
    print("This is inside the brackets.")
    print("Theses statements will be evaluated if my_val is TRUE.")
}

print("This is no longer inside the bounds of the if statement.")
----

In Python, the equivalent code would be: 

[source, python]
----
my_val = True
if my_val:
    print("Where'd the brackets go!?!")
    print("These would still be evaluated as long as my_val is True.")

print("This is no longer part of the if statement.")
----

As you can see, there are no curly braces to indicate the bounds of the statement. Instead, the level of indentation is uses. This applies for loop logic as well: 

[source, python]
----
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for v in values:
    print(f"v: {v}")
----

Code Output: 

----
v: 1
v: 2
v: 3
v: 4
v: 5
----

[NOTE]
====
Python cares when and where you indent. Be sure to pay attention to this while writing code!
