= `argparse`

If you recall from the "Writing Scripts" page, we mentioned that ordering arguments is the easiest way to write your scripts. Unfortunately, this is limited in its functionality -- other people might not know of your forced order and it can be complicated when many arguments are required.

`argparse` is a Python package that solves our problems by creating consistent command-line interfaces and handling the arguments necessary to make your script function.

== Coding Basics

We'll begin by showing `argparse` stripped down to its most basic level. The contents of this tutorial were inspired by xref:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html[Python's `argparse` tutorial] and 

[source,Python]
----
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.parse_args()
----

As with any package, the first step is importing `argparse`. Our `parser` variable is an `ArgumentParser` object, on which we add & parse arguments and ask for help. `parser.parse_args()` is the final step that checks for errors and converts our argument strings into objects.
