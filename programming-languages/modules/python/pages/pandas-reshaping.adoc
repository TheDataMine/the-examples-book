= Reshaping `pandas` Objects

Sometimes the data you receive is inconvenient -- all of it can be useful, but you might have received it with too many redundant columns or a column that would be more useful as an index. To accomodate this, `pandas` has several functions and practices that allow you to reshape your data.

== `pivot`

The `pivot` method is the main method for reshaping, taking arguments for `index`, `columns`, and `values`, whose applications are very straightforward.

* `index`: the _original_ `DataFrame` column whose values will become the *pivoted* `DataFrame` *indices*. 
* `columns`: the _original_ `DataFrame` column whose values will become the *pivoted* `DataFrame` *column names*.
* `values`: the _original_ `DataFrame` column whose values will occupy the *pivoted* `DataFrame` *values*.

Given the sample `DataFrame` below, let's use `pivot` to set `location` as our index values, `week_of_season` as the new columns, and `attendance` as our values: 

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

list_1 = ['Wisconsin', 'IU', 'Rutgers', 'Michigan State', 'Ohio State']
list_2 = ['home', 'away', 'home', 'away', 'home']
list_3 = [85, 78, 90, 75, 74]
list_4 = [500, 1000, 430, 4800, 10000]
list_5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

myDF = pd.DataFrame(zip(list_1, list_2, list_3, list_4, list_5), 
                    columns=['opponent', 'location', 'temp', 'attendance', 'week_of_season'])

print(myDF.pivot(index='location', columns='week_of_season', values='attendance'))
----

----
week_of_season      1       2      3       4        5
location                                             
away              NaN  1000.0    NaN  4800.0      NaN
home            500.0     NaN  430.0     NaN  10000.0
----

`pivot` is easy to use and manipulate, as any column can take the place of `index`, `columns`, and `values` depending on your application.

A notable feature is that `values` can be omitted from the function call, resulting in a higher-order column name for each of the remaining columns, _then_ your values specified in the `columns` parameter. We'll repeat the above example, now making `week_of_season` our index and `location` our column values.

[source,python]
----
football_pivot = myDF.pivot(index='week_of_season', columns='location')
print(football_pivot)
----
----
                      opponent              temp       attendance         
location                  away        home  away  home       away     home
week_of_season                                                            
1                          NaN   Wisconsin   NaN  85.0        NaN    500.0
2                           IU         NaN  78.0   NaN     1000.0      NaN
3                          NaN     Rutgers   NaN  90.0        NaN    430.0
4               Michigan State         NaN  75.0   NaN     4800.0      NaN
5                          NaN  Ohio State   NaN  74.0        NaN  10000.0

Cool! The benefit here is that you have a correctly-shaped `DataFrame` that has all the values you (or your partners) might need in the future. Selecting one column uses standard indexing from this point:

[source,python]
----
print(football_pivot['opponent'])
----
----
location                  away        home
week_of_season                            
1                          NaN   Wisconsin
2                           IU         NaN
3                          NaN     Rutgers
4               Michigan State         NaN
5                          NaN  Ohio State

== Resources
While `pivot` is one of the most used Pandas shaping methods, there are many more helpful methods for different situations. It's recommended to read through the https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/reshaping.html[Pandas doc on reshaping] to get familiar with the other functions that are available.
