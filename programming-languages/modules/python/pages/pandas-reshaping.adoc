= Reshaping in Pandas

== pivot
The `pivot` method from Pandas is a powerful tool that can be used to reshape a DataFrame. `pivot` takes 3 main arguments: `index`, `columns`, and `values`. 

* `index` -> the column of the DataFrame that will be the new index. 
* `columns` -> the column of the DataFrame where you would like each unique value to be mapped to a column.
* `values` -> the column of the DataFrame for which you'd like the values to be. 

For example, given the sample DataFrame below lets say that we wanted to have attendance for home and away games displayed across the different weeks of the season: 

[source, python]
----
list_1 = ['Wisconsin', 'IU', 'Rutgers', 'Michigan State', 'Ohio State']
list_2 = ['home', 'away', 'home', 'away', 'home']
list_3 = [85, 78, 90, 75, 74]
list_4 = [500, 1000, 430, 4800, 10000]
list_5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

myDF = pd.DataFrame(zip(list_1, list_2, list_3, list_4, list_5), columns=['opponent', 'location', 'temp', 'attendance', 'week_of_season'])

print(myDF.pivot(index='location', columns='week_of_season', values='attendance'))
----

----
week_of_season      1       2      3       4        5
location                                             
away              NaN  1000.0    NaN  4800.0      NaN
home            500.0     NaN  430.0     NaN  10000.0
----

If we wanted to we could also swap the columns and indexes: 

[source, python]
----
print(myDF.pivot(index='week_of_season', columns='location', values='attendance'))
----

----
location          away     home
week_of_season                 
1                  NaN    500.0
2               1000.0      NaN
3                  NaN    430.0
4               4800.0      NaN
5                  NaN  10000.0
----

As before, you can also use `reset_index()` to bring the index back in as a column.

[source, python]
----
print(myDF.pivot(index='week_of_season', columns='location', values='attendance').reset_index())
----

----
location  week_of_season    away     home
0                      1     NaN    500.0
1                      2  1000.0      NaN
2                      3     NaN    430.0
3                      4  4800.0      NaN
4                      5     NaN  10000.0

== Resources
While `pivot` is one of the most used Pandas shaping methods, there are many more helpful methods for different situations. It's recommended to read through the https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/reshaping.html[Pandas doc on reshaping] to get familiar with the other functions that are available.
