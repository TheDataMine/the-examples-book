= Reshaping `pandas` Objects

Sometimes the data you receive is inconvenient -- all of it can be useful, but you might have received it with too many redundant columns or a column that would be more useful as an index. To accomodate this, `pandas` has several functions and practices that allow you to reshape your data.

== `pivot`

The `pivot` method is the main method for reshaping, taking arguments for `index`, `columns`, and `values`, whose applications are very straightforward.

* `index`: the _original_ `DataFrame` column whose values will become the *pivoted* `DataFrame` *indices*. 
* `columns`: the _original_ `DataFrame` column whose values will become the *pivoted* `DataFrame` *column names*.
* `values`: the _original_ `DataFrame` column whose values will occupy the *pivoted* `DataFrame` *values*.

Given the sample `DataFrame` below, let's use `pivot` to set `location` as our index values, `week_of_season` as the new columns, and `attendance` as our values: 

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

list_1 = ['Wisconsin', 'IU', 'Rutgers', 'Michigan State', 'Ohio State']
list_2 = ['home', 'away', 'home', 'away', 'home']
list_3 = [85, 78, 90, 75, 74]
list_4 = [500, 1000, 430, 4800, 10000]
list_5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

myDF = pd.DataFrame(zip(list_1, list_2, list_3, list_4, list_5), 
                    columns=['opponent', 'location', 'temp', 'attendance', 'week_of_season'])

print(myDF.pivot(index='location', columns='week_of_season', values='attendance'))
----

----
week_of_season      1       2      3       4        5
location                                             
away              NaN  1000.0    NaN  4800.0      NaN
home            500.0     NaN  430.0     NaN  10000.0
----

`pivot` is easy to use and manipulate, as any column can take the place of `index`, `columns`, and `values` depending on your application.

A notable feature is that `values` can be omitted from the function call, resulting in a higher-order column name for each of the remaining columns, _then_ your values specified in the `columns` parameter. We'll repeat the above example, now making `week_of_season` our index and `location` our column values.

[source,python]
----
football_pivot = myDF.pivot(index='week_of_season', columns='location')
print(football_pivot)
----
----
                      opponent              temp       attendance         
location                  away        home  away  home       away     home
week_of_season                                                            
1                          NaN   Wisconsin   NaN  85.0        NaN    500.0
2                           IU         NaN  78.0   NaN     1000.0      NaN
3                          NaN     Rutgers   NaN  90.0        NaN    430.0
4               Michigan State         NaN  75.0   NaN     4800.0      NaN
5                          NaN  Ohio State   NaN  74.0        NaN  10000.0
----

Cool! The benefit here is that you have a correctly-shaped `DataFrame` that has all the values you (or your partners) might need in the future. Selecting one column uses standard indexing from this point:

[source,python]
----
print(football_pivot['opponent'])
----
----
location                  away        home
week_of_season                            
1                          NaN   Wisconsin
2                           IU         NaN
3                          NaN     Rutgers
4               Michigan State         NaN
5                          NaN  Ohio State

== `melt`

The features of `melt` are split into identifier variables and measured variables:

* The identifiers are _not_ indices, but they are static parts of your data that you want to maintain, such as names or locations. These are usually duplicated for each measured variable you have.
* Measured variables are all the non-identifier columns. They are *melted* into the column `variable`, which contains the names of each measured column, and `value`, each column's corresponding value for that identifier.

We'll show an example before we get too wordy:

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

hail = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "first": ["Purdue", "Dr"],
        "last": ["Pete", "Ward"],
        "topic": ["Cheerleading", "Progeny"],
        "score": [100, 7],
    }
)

print(hail)
----
----
    first  last         topic  score
0  Purdue  Pete  Cheerleading    100
1      Dr  Ward       Progeny      7
----

[source,python]
----
print(hail.melt(id_vars=['first', 'last']))
----
----
    first  last variable         value
0  Purdue  Pete    topic  Cheerleading
1      Dr  Ward    topic       Progeny
2  Purdue  Pete    score           100
3      Dr  Ward    score             7
----

We can interpret `melt` as an anti-`pivot` -- we're minimizing the number of columns by putting more data in rows, resulting in repetition of our identifier variable(s) for each measured variable.

In addition to selecting your identifier variables, you can select your measured variables using `value_vars=`, change "variable" to something else using `var_name=`, and change "value" to something else using `value_name=`.
