= Queries

== Overview

An SQL query is any statement that returns rows or records. Typically, a query will start with the `SELECT` or `SELECT DISTINCT` keywords. For example, the following is a simple SQL query.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE years_of_service > 5;
----

In this example:

* `SELECT` is a statement keyword. 
* `*` is an identifier or selector that means "select all columns".
* `FROM` is a clause that tells the engine from where (which table) we are selecting all of the columns.
* `employees` is an identifier that specifies the "employees" table in the database.
* `WHERE` is an optional clause that specifies under what conditions the engine is to return a record or row.
* `years_of_service` is an identifier that specifies a specific column called "years_of_service" in the "employees" table.
* `>` is an operator that compares two values, and returns TRUE or FALSE.
* `5` is an integer.
* Collectively, `years_of_service > 5` is a xref:terminology.adoc#predicate[predicate].

Ultimately, this query will return all columns from all rows from the "employees" table where the "years_of_service" column has a value greater than 5.
