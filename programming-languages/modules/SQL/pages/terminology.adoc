|`<`
|Less than
|`value < 4`

|>=

|`value >= 4`

|<=

|`value BETWEEN 1 AND 10` or `value NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10`

|[`NOT`] `IN`

|`value IS NULL` or `value IS NOT NULL`

|`IS` [`NOT`] `TRUE`/`FALSE`

|`value IS TRUE` or `value IS FALSE` or `value IS NOT TRUE` or `value IS NOT FALSE`

|`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`
|Is equal to value or both are `NULL`

== Predicates

Predicates are conditions that are evaluated into `true` or `false`. For example, the `furry = TRUE` and `has_claws = FALSE` portions of the following query evaluates to `true`.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM pets WHERE furry = TRUE OR has_claws = FALSE;
----

== Clauses

`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `FROM`, `TOP/LIMIT`, `OFFSET`

== Identifiers

Identifiers are names of database objects, like tables, columns, etc.

== Statements

`SELECT`, `SELECT DISTINCT`, `SELECT INTO`, `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

== Queries

A query is any statement that returns rows. That means, typically, statements that start with the the following keywords.

`SELECT`, `SELECT DISTINCT`
