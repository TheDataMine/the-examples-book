= `sort`

== Basics

`sort` is a function that allows you to arrange an object into ascending or descending order. The relevant arguments include:

* `x`: mandatory; an object that contains a numeric, complex, logical, or character vector.
* `partial`: if not `NULL`, then a vector with indices that will have the correct sorted value.
* `decreasing`: `TRUE` to yield decreasing vector, `FALSE` to yield increasing vector. Default is `FALSE`.

In most situations, you will want to fully sort your object, which is straightforward. 

For partial sorting, you can select indices to display the correct sorted value at those indices, though no other elements are guaranteed to be sorted.

[NOTE]
====
Partial sorting _does_ guarantee two things:

. Everything to the left of the desired index will be smaller than or equal to the sorted element.
. Everything to the right of the desired index will be larger than or equal to the sorted element.

Again, the left and right subsections surrounding an index are not sorted. Partial sorting is quicker than regular sorting due to fewer elements being sorted, which can save considerable time when looking for specific placement in large data sets.

[1]  5  7  6  7  7  7 13 12  8 12 15
----
As we can see, the fifth element is 7.
