== If/else statements

`if`, `else`, and `else if` are keywords in R that allow you to direct the progression of your code. These commands test logical statements, executing certain code depending on the statement's truth.

The structure and requirements of if/else statements are fairly rigid.

* There cannot be an `else` without an `if`.
* `if` statements do not need an `else` -- they can stand alone.
* You may have any amount of `else if` sections, but they must be within `if` and `else` blocks
* `if` and `else if` require logical statements contained within parentheses.
* All blocks must have curly braces, `{` to open and `}` to close, with the desired executable code contained within.

The rules and structure will become clearer in the examples.

==== How do I print "Success!" if my expression is `TRUE`, and "Failure!" otherwise?

====
[source,R]
----
# Randomly assign either TRUE or FALSE to our variable.
t_or_f <- sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),1)

if (t_or_f == TRUE) {
  # If t_or_f is TRUE, print success
  print("Success!")
} else {
  # Otherwise, print failure
  print("Failure!")
}
----
----
[1] "Failure!"
----

For variables that contain either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, we actually don't need the `== TRUE` part of the if-statement. This is because if/else statements intrinsically utilize `TRUE` or `FALSE` values when it comes to executing code.

[source,R]
----
if (t_or_f) {
  print("Success!")
} else {
  print("Failure!")
}

# Randomly assign either TRUE or FALSE to t_or_f.
schrodinger_boolean <- sample(c(TRUE,FALSE,"Something else"), 1)

  print("Success!")
} else if (schrodinger_boolean == FALSE) {
  print("Failure!")
} else {
  print("Huh?")
}
----
----
[1] "Failure!"
----

Unlike in the first example, the sample space of `schrodinger_boolean` includes non-logical elements ("Something else"), so it isn't possible to use the shorthand.

== For loops

`for` loops allow us to execute similar code repeatedly until we've looped through all of an object's elements. For example, if we wanted to format the dates in a list, we could use a `for` loop to run through each element of the list to format it.

While crucial in other programming languages, R has `apply` functions that are faster and more powerful than loops. As with many things, `apply` functions do have situations where they lack efficiency, so learning loops is still vital for mastering R.

This is usually how we write loops in other languages if we want to add the first 10 billion integers.

mytotal <- 0
for (i in 1:10000000000) {

This works, but takes a long time to run. The `sum` function is vectorized, meaning it will consider all values in a vector at the same time. It will very simply take every integer in the parentheses and add them all together.

This is how we find the average cost per line in other languages, for instance, C/C++, Python, Java, etc.
The `for` loop being used here calculates the length of myDF$SPEND, and runs just enough times to reach the end.

[source, R]
----
amountspent <- 0       # we initialize a variable to keep track of the entire price of the purchases
numberofitems <- 0     # and we initialize a variable to keep track of the number of purchases
for (myprice in myDF$SPEND) {
  amountspent <- amountspent + myprice     # we add the price of the current purchase
  numberofitems <- numberofitems + 1       # and we increment (by 1) the number o purchases processed so far
}
amountspent     # this is the total amount spent on all purchases
----
----
[1] 3584366
----

[source, R]
----
numberofitems   # this is the total number of purchases
----
----
[1] 1e+06
----

[source, R]
----
amountspent/numberofitems       # so this is the average
----

[source, R]
----
[1] 3.584366
----

Now, that technically works, but it's not efficient!
Let's try using the `mean` function instead to get an average:

[source, R]
----
mean(myDF$SPEND)
----
----
[1] 3.584366
----

As we can see, mean is a much more efficient way to use a vectorized function in R, to accomplish the same purpose. 
The vector is the column `myDF$SPEND` (where myDF is a dataframe and the $ allows us to specify the SPEND column in this dataframe). 
We can just focus our attention on that column from the data frame, and take a mean.

We'll make a vector called "mystatus" that matches the length of our existing data.frame, setting the default value to "safe" for every entry.

[source,R]
----
mystatus <- rep("safe", times=nrow(myDF))
----

xref:./rep.adoc[`rep`] is perfect for our needs. 

Looking at `PURCHASE_`, we see that the format is DD-MMM-YY, corresponding to 2-digit day, 3-character month abbreviation, and last two values of the year. We can now change the entries for the elements of `mystatus` that occurred on `05-JUL-16` or on `06-JUL-16` to "contaminated".

[source,R]
----
mystatus[(myDF$PURCHASE_ == "05-JUL-16")|(myDF$PURCHASE_ == "06-JUL-16")] <- "contaminated"
----

Remember that `myDF$PURCHASE_ ==` will give us an index, and since `length(mystatus) == nrow(myDF)`, the indices will match. We can xref:variables#factors[`factor`] `mystatus` to create a categorical vector, then rename it and add it to `myDF`.

[source,R]
----
myDF$safetystatus <- factor(mystatus)
----

Now the head of the data.frame looks like this...

[source,R]

head(myDF)
