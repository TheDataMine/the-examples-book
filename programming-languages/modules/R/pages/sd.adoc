= `sd`

`sd` is a function that calculates the standard deviation of a vector of values, or of the values in a data.frame's column.

[NOTE]
====
Standard deviation can also be manually calculated using the following equation: `sqrt(sum((ln - mean(data)) ^ 2 / (length(data) - 1)))` where `data` is our vector or data.frame. This page will discuss using the `sd` function as a replacement to manually calculating the standard deviation, but this is a great tool to cross-check our code to ensure it works.
