= `dim`

== Basics
`dim` is a function that allows us to return or set the dimension of an object. We read the output/input of `dim` as [rows, columns].

#Let's set x to include every number from 1 to 9.
x <- 1:9
x
----

----
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
----

As we can see, `x` is a one-dimensional vector with 9 values, which we can say is 1 row and 9 columns. Let's make `x` a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns.

[source, R]
----
dim(x) <- c(3, 3)
x
----

----
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9
----

As we can see from this example, R fills the columns before the rows when changing a vector to a matrix.
