= `rep`

== Basics

`rep` is short for **rep**licate. It accepts an object, `x`, and up to three additional arguments: `times`, `length.out`, and `each`.

* `times` is a non-negative number of repetitions for the whole object `x`.

* `length.out` specifies the end length you want the result to be. 

* `each` specifies the number of times each element in `x` will be repeated.

`rep` will repeat the values in `x` as many times as it takes to reach the provided `length.out`.

[source,R]

vec <- c(1,2,3)
rep(vec, times=3)

# this matches `rep(vec,3)` -- however, we recommend naming arguments to help people who read your code in the future

[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

When adding vectors in R, the objects must be the same size _or_ one object's length must be a **multiple** of the other. If the second option occurs, R utilizes vector recycling, where the tracking of the shorter vector is looped when all its values are exhausted.

Since this does not work when the vectors do not share a multiple, we can use `rep` to guarantee vector addition, even if we don't know length.

First, the implication of adding `vec` to `other_vec` with no checks:

[source,R]
----
vec + other_vec
----
----
`Warning in vec + other_vec: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length`
----

Not what we want. Now, using `rep` as we did above, we get the following:

[source,R]
----
# Left of + matches the code above, both left and right side now have length 8

rep(vec, length.out=length(other_vec)) + other_vec
----
----
[1]  2  4  5  3  4  5  3 10
----

Perfect! Now we know how to use vector recycling when the vectors are not multiples of one another.
