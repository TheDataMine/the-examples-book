= `paste` and `paste0`

== Basics

`paste` is a function that converts vector elements to character strings and then concatenates them. It has a `sep` argument (default `sep = " "`) where the user can include a phrase/string to separate the strings being pasted together

`paste0` is a version of `paste` where its `sep` argument is "", meaning the strings will be linked with no characters in between.
