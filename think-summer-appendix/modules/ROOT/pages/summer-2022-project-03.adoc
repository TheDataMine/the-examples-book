== Questions

=== Question 1

A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies a row in the table. Primary keys must be unique values. This is enforced at the database level. 

A foreign key is a field whose value matches a primary key in a different table.

Examine all six of the tables in the `imdb` database:
`akas`, `crew`, `episodes`, `people`, `ratings`, `titles`.
Identify each of the primary keys in each table, and identify each of the foreign keys in each table.

.Items to submit
====
- List any primary keys in the tables. _(1 pt)_
- List any foreign keys in the tables. _(1 pt)_
- Any code you used to answer this question.

=== Question 2

If you paste a `title_id` to the end of the following url, it will pull up the page for the title. For example, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573 leads to the page for the TV series Grey's Anatomy. Write a SQL query to confirm that the `title_id` "tt0413573" does indeed belong to Grey's Anatomy. Then browse https://imdb.com and find your favorite TV show. Get the `title_id` from the url of your favorite TV show, and run the following query to confirm that the TV show is in our database.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE title_id='<title id here>';
----

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure to replace "<title id here>" with the `title_id` of your favorite show. If your show does not appear, or has only a single season, pick another show until you find one we have in our database (that has multiple seasons).

- SQL query used to confirm that `title_id` "tt0413573" does indeed belong to Grey's Anatomy. _(.5 pts)_
- The output of the query. _(.5 pt)_
- The `title_id` of your favorite TV show. _(.5 pts)_
- SQL query used to confirm the `title_id` for your favorite TV show. _(.5 pts)_
====

=== Question 3

The `episode_title_id` column in the `episodes` table references titles of individual episodes of a TV series. The `show_title_id` references the titles of the show itself. With that in mind, write a query that gets a list of all of the `episodes_title_id`'s (found in the `episodes` table), with the associated `primary_title` (found in the `titles` table) for each episode of Grey's Anatomy.

=== Question 4

Joins are a critical concept to understand. They appear everywhere where relational data is found. In R, the `merge` function performs the same operations as joins. In python's `pandas` package the `merge` method for the `DataFrame` object performs the same operations. Take some time to read xref:programming-languages:SQL:joins.adoc[this section]. 

In question 2 from the previous project, we asked you to use the `ratings` table to discover how many films have a rating of at least 8 and at least 50000 votes. You may have noticed, while you can easily do that, the end result is not human understandable. We see that there are films with those features but we don't know what film `title_id` "tt0010323" is for. This is a great example where a simple join can answer this question for us.

Write a query that prints the `primary_title`, `rating`, and `votes` for all films with a rating of at least 8 and at least 50000 votes. Like in the previous version of this question, limit your output to 15 results.

[WARNING]

The following are challenge questions and are worth 0 points. If you get done early give them a try!

=== Question 5

We want to write a query that returns the title and rating of the highest rated episode of your favorite TV show, which you chose in <<question-2, question 2>>. In order to do so, we will break the task into two parts in (5) and (6). First, write a query that returns a list of _just_ `episode_title_ids` (found in the `episodes` table), with the associated `primary_title` (found in the `titles` table) for each episode.

====
- SQL query used to answer the question.
- Output from running the SQL query. 
==== 

=== Question 6

Write a query that adds the rating to the end of each episode. To do so, use the query you wrote in (5) as a subquery. Which episode has the highest rating? Is it also your favorite episode?
