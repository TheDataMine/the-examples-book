== Submission

Students need to submit the following file **by 10:00PM EST** through Gradescope inside Brightspace.

. A Jupyter notebook (a `.ipynb` file).

We've provided you with a template notebook for you to use. Please carefully read xref:summer-2022-project-template.adoc[this section] to get started.

[CAUTION]

== Questions

=== Question 1

Aggregate functions like `COUNT, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, and `MAX` are very useful. In particular, running queries like the following are great.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titles WHERE premiered = 2008;
----

However, in this scenario we want to know how many movies premiered in 2008. How often would we rather just see these numbers for _every_ year, rather than 1 year at a time? This is where aggregate functions really start to have more power.

In the `titles` table, the `premiered` column specifies the year that a movie was premiered. Use `COUNT` to find how many movies premiered in each year in the database, in a single query.

[IMPORTANT]
Use **only** SQL to answer this question.

[NOTE]
If you feel like practicing your R skills, try and solve this using R instead of SQL (for 0 points).

=== Question 2

In <<question-1, question (1)>>, we have an example that starts to demonstrate how those simple aggregate functions are really quite powerful. The results, however, do have some ways that they could be improved. Improve your solution to <<question-1, question (1)>> in the following ways:

. Use xref:programming-languages:SQL:aliasing.adoc[aliasing] to rename the results of the `COUNT` function, so that rather than being labeled `COUNT(*)`, the column appears as `movies premiered`. 
. While it can be interesting to see the number of movies premiering long ago, perhaps we don't need to see all of this information. Edit your query to only include movies from 1970+.

=== Question 3

Who used `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` to update your query from <<question-2, question (2)>>? While that is one way to solve that question, the more robust way would be to use the `HAVING` clause. Use `HAVING` to limit the query to only include movies premiering in 1970+.

=== Question 4

Let's try to combine a little bit of everything we've learned so far. In the previous project, you picked a TV series to perform queries on. Use that same TV series (or, if you don't want to choose a TV series, title_id "tt0413573" is a good one to use) for this question.

We want to get the `episode_number`, `season_number`, `primary_title`, `title_id`, and `rating` of every episode of your TV series for _only_ seasons where the average `rating` was at least X, in a single query.

This will be a large query with multiple joins, and sub-queries. For this reason, we will break this down into parts, each worth some points.

==== Part 1

First, write a query that gets the `episode_title_id` and `season_number` for every episode of our TV show.

==== Part 2

Next, use your query from <<part-1, part (1).. as a sub-query, and get the `season_number`'s for the seasons with an average `rating` of at least 8.0. The result should be a single column (`season_number`) with 11 values (if you are using title_id "tt0413573").

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember that a TV show may have an overall rating _and_ individual episode ratings. For example, for Grey's Anatomy, you can get the overall rating by running this query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT rating FROM ratings WHERE title_id = 'tt0413573';
----

But, we want you to get the average rating, by season.
====

==== Part 3

Write a query that gets the `episode_number`, `season_number`, `primary_title`, and `title_id` for the TV show with your title_id (for example, "tt0413573"). Make sure to order the results first by `season_number` and then by `episode_number`.

==== Part 4 

At this stage there are only 2 missing components to our query from <<part-3, part (3)>>. First is the fact that _all_ episodes from _all_ seasons are returned. To address this, use logical `AND` and the `IN` operator to limit the returned episodes from your <<part-3, part (3) query>> to only the `season_number`'s returned in your <<part-2, part (2) query>>. 

[TIP]
====
This may _sound_ difficult, but it isn't! Start with your <<part-3, part (3) query>>, and tack on `AND <column name> IN (<sub query>)`. Of course, you need to fill in `<column name>` with the correct column name, and `<sub query>` with our <<part-2, part (2) query>>.
====

==== Part 5

Finally, the last missing component is the individual `rating` for each episode. Simply start with your query from <<part-4, part (4)>>, and perform a join with the `rating` table to get the `rating` for each episode.

In addition, the `rating` isn't available in our query from <<part-3, part (3)>>.
