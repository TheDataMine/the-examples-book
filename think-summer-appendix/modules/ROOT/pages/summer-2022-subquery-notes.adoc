We can find the information from the episodes of Friends:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' LIMIT 5;
----

and then we can use this query as a subquery, to select the season numbers from the episodes of Friends:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT s.season_number 
FROM (SELECT * FROM episodes WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778') AS s LIMIT 5;
----

Here is another example.  We can find the movies from 1989:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE (premiered = '1989') AND (type = 'movie') LIMIT 5;
----

and then we can use this query as a subquery, to find the average length of movies from 1989, given in minutes:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT AVG(s.runtime_minutes) 
FROM (SELECT * FROM titles WHERE (premiered = '1989') AND (type = 'movie')) AS s LIMIT 5;
