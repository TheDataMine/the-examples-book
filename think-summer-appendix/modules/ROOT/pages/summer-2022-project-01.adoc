= Think Summer: Project 1 -- 2022

== Submission

Students need to submit the following file **by 10:00PM EST** through Gradescope inside Brightspace.

. A Jupyter notebook (a `.ipynb` file).

We've provided you with a template notebook for you to use. Please carefully read xref:summer-2022-project-template.adoc[this section] to get started.

[CAUTION]
====
When you are finished with the project, please make sure to run every cell in the notebook prior to submitting. To do this click menu:Run[Run All Cells]. Next, to export your notebook (your `.ipynb` file), click on menu:File[Download], and download your `.ipynb` file.

== Questions

=== Question 1

Read some information on SQL xref:programming-languages:SQL:introduction.adoc[here]. Explore the 6 tables in the database, and state 1 interesting fact that you find about at least one of the tables.

[TIP]
====
Normally, when using SQLite, the easiest way to display the tables in the database is by running `.table` or `.tables`. This is SQLite-specific behavior and therefore cannot be used in our Jupyter Lab environment. To show the tables using an R cell, run the following.

[source,r]
----
dbListTables(conn)
----

To list the tables using a SQL cell, run the following.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT
    name
FROM
    sqlite_master
WHERE
    TYPE IN('table', 'view')
    AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%'
ORDER BY
    1;
----

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to explore the database. _(1 pt)_
- A sentence describing at least 1 interesting fact about at least one of the tables. _(1 pt)_
====

=== Question 2

Find and print the `title_id`, `rating`, and number of votes (`votes`) for all movies that received **at least** 2 million votes. In a second query (and new cell), use the information you found in the previous query to identify the `primary_title` of these movies. 

[TIP]
Use the `ratings` table for the first query, and the `titles` table for the second.

.Items to submit
====
- SQL queries used to solve this problem. _(2 pts)_
- Output from running the SQL query. _(1 pt)_
====

=== Question 3

Find the `primary_title` of every _movie_ that is over 2 hours long or that premiered after 1990. Order the result from newest premier year to oldest, and limit the output to 15 movies. Make sure `premiered` and `runtime_minutes` are not `NULL`.  After displaying these 15 movies, run the query again in a second cell, but this time only display the number of such movies.

[CAUTION]
====
Make sure the `type` column is "movie".
====

[TIP]
Be careful! Order of operations is important here.

.Items to submit
====
- SQL query used to solve this problem. _(3 pts)_
- Explain in 1-2 sentences why order of operations is important here. _(1 pt)_
- Output from running the SQL query. _(1 pt)_

[WARNING]
====
The following are challenge questions and are worth 0 points. If you get done early give them a try!

=== Question 4

What actor has the longest name? Answer this question using just SQL.

.Items to submit
====
- SQL query used to solve this problem.
- Output from running this query.
====

=== Question 5

`LIKE` is a very powerful tool. You can read about SQLite's version of `LIKE` https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/core-functions-like.php[here]. Use `LIKE` and/or R to get a count of how many movies (type='movie') that starts with each letter of the alphabet. Can you think of another way to do this? If so, show us, and explain what you did!

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- 1-2 sentences explaining what your code does and why you like your method of solving the problem.
