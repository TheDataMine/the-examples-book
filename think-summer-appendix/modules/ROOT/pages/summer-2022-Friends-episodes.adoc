= Think Summer: Notes on how to find Friends episodes -- 2022

We first load the SQL database:

[source,sql]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

Then we load the first few lines of the `titles` table.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

and we check which shows after 1992 were called Friends.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE (primary_title = 'Friends') AND (premiered > 1992) LIMIT 5;
----

So now we know that `tt0108778` is the `show_title_id` for Friends.

Next, we load some lines from the `episodes` table.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes LIMIT 5;
----

and we focus attention on the episodes corresponding to Friends.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' LIMIT 5;
----

Remember, there are 235 such episodes.  As we discovered earlier, there are actually 236 episodes of Friends, but in the database, they combined the two episodes from `The Last One` into one episode listing.  So only 235 entries appear in our database.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM episodes WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' LIMIT 5;
----

Now we pull in the title of the show itself (Friends) from the `titles` table.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes AS e JOIN titles AS t ON e.show_title_id = t.title_id
WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' LIMIT 5;
----

Finally, we join the `titles` again, but this time, we join the titles table to the `episodes` by the `episode_title_id`, in other words, we extract the names of the episodes.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes AS e JOIN titles AS t ON e.show_title_id = t.title_id
JOIN titles AS u ON e.episode_title_id = u.title_id
WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' LIMIT 5;
----
