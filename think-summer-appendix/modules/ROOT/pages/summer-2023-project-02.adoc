== How many crews include George Lucas in the role of `director`?

George Lucas is in the role of director in 18 crews.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crew WHERE person_id = 'nm0000184' AND category = 'director';
----

Alternatively, if we do not want to manually lookup George Lucas's `person_id` value, we could solve this one as follows:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crew AS c JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id WHERE p.name = 'George Lucas' and c.category = 'director';
----





== How many shows have more than 10000 episodes?  Hint:  Use the `episodes` table, and `GROUP BY` the `show_title_id` and use the condition `HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000` at the end of the query.

There are three shows that each have more than 10000 episodes.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*), show_title_id FROM episodes GROUP BY show_title_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000 LIMIT 5;
----





== What are the 3 most popular episodes of Friends?  Please include the title of each episode.  Please verify your answer by double-checking with IMDB.

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!)

Hint:  Friends has `show_title_id = tt0108778`.

Another hint:  When you join the `episodes` table and the `ratings` table, you might want to add the condition `e.episode_title_id = r.title_id`

Another hint:  You might want to have `ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 3` at the end of your query, so that you are ordering the results by the ratings, and putting them in descending order (with the biggest at the top).


[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes AS e JOIN ratings AS r ON e.episode_title_id = r.title_id WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 3;
----

If we want to know the titles of the episodes, then we can `JOIN` with the `titles` table.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT primary_title, season_number, episode_number, rating, votes
FROM episodes AS e
JOIN ratings AS r ON e.episode_title_id = r.title_id
JOIN titles AS t ON e.episode_title_id = t.title_id
WHERE show_title_id = 'tt0108778' 
ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 3;
----





== Identify the 6 movies that have rating 9 or higher and have 50000 or more votes.

We `JOIN` the `titles` and the `ratings` tables, with the conditions on the `type` and `votes` and `rating`, and we get the required 6 movies.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles AS t JOIN ratings AS r ON t.title_id = r.title_id WHERE t.type = 'movie' AND r.votes > 50000 and r.rating >= 9 ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 10;
----






== For how many movies has Sean Connery been on the `crew`?

We `JOIN` the `crew` table and the `people` table and the `titles` table, and we discover that Sean Connery was in 69 crews.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crew AS c
JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id
JOIN titles AS t ON c.title_id = t.title_id
WHERE p.name = 'Sean Connery' AND t.type = 'movie';
----





== Revisiting the question about George Lucas:  What are the titles of the movies in which George Lucas had the role of `director`?

We can include a `JOIN` with the `titles` table, so that we know the titles; here, we are limiting the titles to movies so we only have 6 titles, instead of the original 18 titles:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM crew AS c JOIN titles AS t ON c.title_id = t.title_id WHERE c.person_id = 'nm0000184' AND c.category = 'director' AND t.type = 'movie';
----






== Revisiting the question about the shows that have more than 10000 episodes, please find the `primary_title` of these shows.

We can `JOIN` with the titles table, if we want to get the names of the shows.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*), show_title_id, t.primary_title FROM episodes AS e JOIN titles AS t ON e.show_title_id = t.title_id GROUP BY show_title_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000 LIMIT 5;
----









== Revisiting the question about how many movies has Sean Connery been on the `crew`:  Which movie is his most popular movie?

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!)

We can now also `JOIN` the `rating` table, and we see that Sean Connery's highest ratest movie, if we consider the `rating` (rather than the `votes`) is `Ever to Excel`

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM crew AS c
JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id
JOIN titles AS t ON c.title_id = t.title_id
JOIN ratings AS r ON c.title_id = r.title_id
WHERE p.name = 'Sean Connery' AND t.type = 'movie'
ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 1;
----

but if we instead consider the number of votes, then his highest ratest movie is `Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade`

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM crew AS c
JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id
JOIN titles AS t ON c.title_id = t.title_id
JOIN ratings AS r ON c.title_id = r.title_id
WHERE p.name = 'Sean Connery' AND t.type = 'movie'
ORDER BY r.votes DESC LIMIT 1;
----








== Again revisiting the previous question about the popularity of movies for which Sean Connery has been on the `crew`:  Which movie is his most popular movie, if we limit our query to results with 1000 or more votes?  What is the title of the most popular result?

(For this question, use `rating` for popularity, i.e., please focus on high `rating` values.)

Adding the condition `r.votes >= 1000`, we see that `Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade` is the most popular by this measure.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM crew AS c
JOIN people AS p ON c.person_id = p.person_id
JOIN titles AS t ON c.title_id = t.title_id
JOIN ratings AS r ON c.title_id = r.title_id
WHERE p.name = 'Sean Connery' AND t.type = 'movie'
AND r.votes >= 1000
ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 1;
