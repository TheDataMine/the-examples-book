=== Question 3

What are the 5 most popular episodes of Friends?  Please include the title of each episode.  Please verify your answer by double-checking with IMDB.

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!)

Hint:  Friends has `show_title_id = tt0108778`.

Another hint:  When you join the `episodes` table and the `ratings` table, you might want to add the condition `e.episode_title_id = r.title_id`

Another hint:  You might want to have `ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 3` at the end of your query, so that you are ordering the results by the ratings, and putting them in descending order (with the biggest at the top).
