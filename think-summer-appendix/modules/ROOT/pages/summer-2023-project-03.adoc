== Questions

=== Question 1

How many flights departed from O'Hare (`ORD`) and landed in Denver (`DEN`)?

.Items to submit
====
- R used to solve this problem. _(2 pts)_
- Output from running R. _(1 pt)_

=== Question 2

What is the Distance (in miles) of any individual flight from O'Hare to Denver?

- Output from running R. _(1 pt)_
====

=== Question 3

Consider only the flights that arrive to Honolulu (airport code `HNL`), i.e., for which Honolulu is the destination.  What are the 10 most popular origin airports?

=== Question 4

Each airplane has a unique `TailNum`.  Which airplane flew the most flights in 2005?  Hint:  If you strictly look at the `TailNum` values, you will need to ignore the top two results, because they are missing data.

=== Question 5

Which airplane flew the largest number of times from O'Hare to Denver?  Hint:  Again, if you strictly look at the `TailNum` values, you will need to ignore the top result, because it has missing data.

=== Question 6

What were the 10 most popular days of the year to fly in 2005 (where "popularity" is evaluated by the number of flights on that day)?  Hint:  You might paste together the year, month, and day of the flights.

=== Question 7

In which month are the average departure delays the worst?  Hint:  You might use a tapply function.

=== Question 8

Make a `dotchart` that illustrates the data from the previous question (about the average flight delays in each month).

=== Question 9

The `UniqueCarrier` is the airline carrier for the flight.  If you add all of the miles flown (in the `Distance`) for each airline carrier, which carrier flew the most miles altogether in 2005?  Hint:  You might use a tapply function.
