= Think Summer: Project 1 -- 2021

== Submission

Students need to submit the following 2 files **by 10:00PM EST** through Gradescope inside Brightspace.

. A compiled PDF.
. A `.asciidoc` file.

To create these files, the first step is to run every cell in the notebook. To do this click menu:Run[Run All Cells]. Next, to create the PDF, click on menu:File[Export Notebook As...> PDF]. Last, to create the `.asciidoc` file, click on menu:File[Export Notebook As... > Asciidoc].

[IMPORTANT]
When you export the `.asciidoc` file, it may download a `.zip` file. Make sure to extract and submit **only** the `.asciidoc` file contained therein. You are subject to lose credit if you submit the `.zip` file instead of the `.asciidoc` file.

== Project

**Motivation:** SQL is an incredibly powerful tool that allows you to process and filter massive amounts of data -- amounts of data where tools like spreadsheets start to fail. You can perform SQL queries directly within the R environment, and doing so allows you to quickly perform ad-hoc analyses.

**Context:** This project is specially designed for Purdue University's Think Summer program, in conjunction with Purdue University's integrative data science initiative, https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine].

**Scope:** SQL, SQL in R

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to interact with popular database management systems within R.
- Solve data-driven problems using a combination of SQL and R.
- Use basic SQL commands: select, order by, limit, desc, asc, count, where, from.
- Perform grouping and aggregate data using group by and the following functions: count, max, sum, avg, like, having.
****

== Dataset

The following questions will use the `imdb` database found in Scholar, our computing cluster.

This database has 6 tables, namely:

`akas`, `crew`, `episodes`, `people`, `ratings`, and `titles`.

You have a variety of options to connect with, and run queries on our database:

. Run SQL queries directly within a Jupyter Lab cell.
. Connect to and run queries from within R in a Jupyter Lab cell.
. From a terminal in Scholar.

For consistency and simplicity, we will only cover how to do (1) and (2).

First, for both (1) and (2) you must launch a new Jupyter Lab instance. To do so, please follow the instructions below.

. Open a browser and navigate to https://gateway.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu, and login using your Purdue Career Account credentials. You should be presented with a screen similar to figure (1).
+
image::figure01.webp[OnDemand, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="OnDemand"]
+
. Click on "My Interactive Sessions", and you should be presented with a screen similar to figure (2).
+
image::figure02.webp[Your interactive Scholar sessions, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Your interactive Scholar sessions"]
+
. Click on Jupyter Lab in the left-hand menu. You should be presented with a screen similar to figure (3). Select the following settings:
+
* Queue: scholar (Max 4.0 hours)
* Number of hours: 2.5
* Processor cores requested: 1
* Memory requested (in Mb): 5120
+
image::figure03.webp[Jupyter Lab settings, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Jupyter Lab settings"]
+
. When satisfied, click btn:[Launch], and wait for a minute. In a few moments, you should be presented with a screen similar to figure (4).
+
image::figure04.webp[Jupyter Lab ready to connect, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Jupyter Lab ready to connect"]
+
. When you are ready, click btn:[Connect to Jupyter]. A new browser tab will launch and you will be presented with a screen similar to figure (5).
+
image::figure05.webp[Kernel menu, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Kernel menu"]
+
. Under the "Notebook" menu, please select the btn:[f2021-s2022] (look for the big "F"). Finally, you will be presented with a screen similar to figure (6). 
+
image::figure06.webp[Ready Jupyter Lab notebook, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Ready-to-use Jupyter Lab notebook"]
+
You now have a running Jupyter Lab notebook ready for you to use. This Jupyter Lab instance is running on the https://scholar.rcac.purdue.edu[Scholar cluster] in the basement of the MATH building. By using OnDemand, you've essentially carved out a small portion of the compute power to use. Congratulations! Now please follow along below depending on whether you'd like to do <<option-1,option (1)>> or <<option-2,option (2)>>.

[#option-1]
To run queries directly in a Jupyter Lab cell (1), please do the following.

. In the first cell, run the following code. This code loads an extension that allows you to directly run SQL queries in a cell as long as that cell has `%%sql` at the top of the cell.
+
[source, txt]
----
%load_ext sql
%sql sqlite:////class/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----
+ 
. After running that cell (for example, using kbd:[Ctrl+Enter]), you can directly run future queries in each cell by starting the cell with `%%sql` in the first line. For example.
+
[source, sql]
----
%%sql

SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----
+
While this method has its advantages, there are some advantages to having interop between R and SQL -- for example, you could quickly create cool graphics using data in the database and R. 

[#option-2]
To run queries from within R (2), please do the following.

. In the first cell, run the following code. This code loads an extension that allows you to directly run R code in a cell as long as that cell has `%%R` at the top of the cell.
+
[source,txt]
----
%load_ext rpy2.ipython
----
+
. After running that cell (for example, using kbd:[Ctrl+Enter]), you can directly run R code in any cell that starts with `%%R` in the first line. For example.
+
[source,r]
----
%%R

my_vec <- c(1,2,3)
my_vec
----
+
Now, because we are able to run R code, we can connect to the database, make queries, and build plots, all in a single cell. For example.
+
[source,r]
----
%%R

library(RSQLite)
library(ggplot2)

conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "/class/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db")
myDF <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;")

ggplot(myDF) +
    geom_point(aes(x=primary_title, y=runtime_minutes)) +
    labs(x = 'Title', y= 'Minutes') 
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
It is perfectly acceptable to mix and match SQL cells and R cells in your project.

== Questions

=== Question 1

Read some information on SQL xref:book:SQL:introduction.adoc[here]. Explore the 6 tables in the database, and state 1 interesting fact that you find about at least one of the tables.

[TIP]
====
Normally, when using SQLite, the easiest way to display the tables in the database is by running `.table` or `.tables`. This is SQLite-specific behavior and therefore cannot be used in our Jupyter Lab environment. To show the tables using an R cell, run the following.

[source,r]
----
dbListTables(conn)
----

To list the tables using a SQL cell, run the following.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT
    name
FROM
    sqlite_master
WHERE
    TYPE IN('table', 'view')
    AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%'
ORDER BY
    1;
----

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to explore the database. _(1 pt)_
- A sentence describing at least 1 interesting fact about at least one of the tables. _(1 pt)_
====

=== Question 2

Find and print the `title_id`, `rating`, and number of votes (`votes`) for all movies that received **at least** 2 million votes. In a second query (and new cell), use the information you found in the previous query to identify the `primary_title` of these movies. 

[TIP]
Use the `ratings` table for the first query, and the `titles` table for the second.

[TIP]
**At least** _includes_ a movie having exactly 2,000,000 votes.

=== Question 3

Find the `primary_title` of every _movie_ that is over 2 hours long or that premiered after 1990. Order the result from newest premier year to oldest, and limit the output to 15 movies. Make sure `premiered` and `runtime_minutes` are not `NULL`.
