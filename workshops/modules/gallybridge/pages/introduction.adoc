WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME!


The lesson plan is intended to be structured in a way that anyone with any background will be able to play around to learn what data science can do.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, that's normal! This is all new and hopefully fun, BUT it also can mean that we could do a better job explaining our work, and we welcome any feedback!
