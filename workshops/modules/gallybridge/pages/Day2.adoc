# Schedule for Day 2

Now that we know where the victim was found let's see if we can use weather data to learn anything more. 

Today's session is all about exporatory data analysis or EDA. 

== Getting Weather Data

The first challenge we have is finding a place to get data. There are lots of organizations that make data available to anyone who is interested. This is called open-source data. 

In coding languages, like Python, there are also packages that we can use. Packages group useful code together for easy use. 

In this case we can use the https://github.com/meteostat/meteostat-python[meteostat Python package] to get open-source weather data.
