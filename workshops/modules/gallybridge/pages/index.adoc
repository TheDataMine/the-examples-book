Someone has been murdered. Where was the victim? Who killed the victim? Why did the murderer kill the victim? How did it happen?

Let's solve the case using data science. 

The lesson plan is intended to be structured in a way that anyone with any background will be able to play around to learn what data science can do.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, that's normal! This is all new and hopefully fun, BUT it also can mean that we could do a better job explaining our work, and we welcome any feedback!
