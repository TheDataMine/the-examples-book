# Schedule for Day 4

## Session 7
9 AM - 12 PM

## Session 8
1 PM - 5 PM

== Introduction

We are going to continue to see if we can uncover clues that will help the investigators uncover the murderer. 

To do this we are going to use some controversial data, phone records. 

In this case we simulated the data as an example, but it is important to note that many companies and applications do track location data for their users. 

== Geospatial Data

Today we get to work with a really interesting type of data, geospatial data. 

This data looks very similar to the data that we've used so far with one important difference. This data has information about the location in the world. 

Location can be found in different ways. In this case we have latitude and longitdue. 

The other cool part about geospatial data is that we have many open-source options. For this part of the process we'll start with the https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/e8299c86b4014f109fedd7e95ae20d52/explore?location=38.893696%2C-77.019147%2C12.42[DC street map data] that is provided by the city.  

== Practice Exercises

. We will start by importing all the different Python packages that we will need and taking a look at the DC street map data.
