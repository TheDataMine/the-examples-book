# Schedule for Day 4

## Session 7
9 AM - 12 PM

## Session 8
1 PM - 5 PM

== Introduction

We are going to continue to see if we can uncover clues that will help the investigators uncover the murderer. 

To do this we are going to use some controversial data, phone records. 

In this case we simulated the data as an example, but it is important to note that many companies and applications do track location data for their users. 

== Geospatial Data

Today we get to work with a really interesting type of data, geospatial data. 

This data looks very similar to the data that we've used so far with one important difference. This data has information about the location in the world. 

Location can be found in different ways. In this case we have latitude and longitdue. 

The other cool part about geospatial data is that we have many open-source options. For this part of the process we'll start with the https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/e8299c86b4014f109fedd7e95ae20d52/explore?location=38.893696%2C-77.019147%2C12.42[DC street map data] that is provided by the city.  

== Practice Exercises

. We will start by importing all the different Python packages that we will need and taking a look at the DC street map data.

This is a very interesting map, but it's hard to read. We will do something about that, but first we can take a look at the raw data as well. 
+
. Let's print out the raw data to better understand the dataset.

We can see that the DC streets data looks pretty similar to what we've been working with. 
+
The biggest difference are the `geometry` rows. These are sets of latitude and longitude points that Python understands spatially. 
+
This means that we can use these points for different sptial functions, like finding distance. 
+
First though, lets cut down our huge map to our area of interest. We'll define our general area of interest around the Mall using Google Maps. 
+
. Let's cut down our map to a smaller scale.

This data looks pretty similar to our DC streets data. It has dates and times as well as the ID for the caller. The most important parts are the `lat` and `lon` columns that we can use to map the caller's path.

. Let's map out our data and see what it looks like!

This is an interesting map, but it's *very* noisy. For our next step lets see if we can limit the map to only calls that went near where our victim was found. 
+
In this section you'll see references to `crs` with some odd looking numbers and letters after them like `epsg:4326`. These are what are known as coordinate reference systems. 
+
Their specific detail is beyond the scope of this workshop, but at a high-level they help convert coordinates to address different ways of looking at the earth. 
+
In our case, we have to convert the CRS' to something that is better for measuring distance in North America. 
+
. Lets calculate the distance from our victim's location to all of the lat/lon points that we have in the phone record.
