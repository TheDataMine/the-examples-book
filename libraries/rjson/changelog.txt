0.2.17: Jun 25, 2017
	Fixed examples that refferenced True/False instead of TRUE/FALSE
0.2.16: Nov 30, 2014
	Added simplify=TRUE option to fromJSON, when True, lists are simplified into vectors 
	(default is backwards compatible); when set to False, all json-encoded lists are kept as R lists.
0.2.15: Nov 2, 2014
	bugfix: toJSON was not escaping control characters 0-0x1f, and 0x7f. (Thanks to Early Ehlinger for patch)
0.2.14: June 10, 2014
	Fixed bug where fromJSON("{\"a\": 0,}") returned a list() rather than raising an error regarding the trailing comma. (Thanks Stavros Macrakis for the report)
0.2.12: Jan 14, 2013
	Added unexpected.escape to the "C" fromJSON method. This allows users to parse invalid json containing bad escaped data. 
	Defaults to raising an error as the old version did. Also added position to error/warning messages
0.2.11: Nov 29, 2012
	Fixed toJSON bug where factors were saved as integers rather than strings
0.2.10: Sep 30, 2012
	Fixed precission issue in toJSON's C implementation where doubles only had 6 digits (as the std::iostream default specified). Now it should be the full precission. (Thanks Michael)
	Fixed issue where toJSON(..., "R") never passed the "R" value on recursive calls (so it ended up calling the (potentially buggy) C version
0.2.9: July 22, 2012
	Fixed vector toJSON bug where toJSON(numeric(0)) would return "" instead of "[]" (thanks Diego Forteza)
0.2.8: Mar 18, 2012
	Changed ordering of includes in dump.cpp to fix compilation issue on OSX (thanks Rob)
0.2.7: Mar 12, 2012
	rewrote toJSON to use a C implementation which is much faster. Thanks to Simon for the reminder.
0.2.6: Oct 17, 2011
	bufix: fromJSON('["A",["B","C"]]') incorrectly returned "A" "B" (thanks Brad Friedman for reporting it)
	bufix: fromJSON('["A", null]', method="R") was using NA rather than NULL (missed case from version 0.1.6)
0.2.4: June 26, 2011
	bugfix: too hasty with the previous release, and introduced a bug for characters greater than 512 bytes (was blindly doubling the buffer size when sometimes it needed more)
0.2.4: June 25, 2011
	bugfix: memory issue when parsing strings with mostly (or only) escaped characters greater than 256bytes
0.2.3: Dec 12, 2010
	bugfix: allow '\r' to b whitespace rather than just use '\n'
0.2.2: Nov 29, 2010
	bugfix: protection stack overflow - now uses PROTECT_WITH_INDEX() rather pushing far too many protects on to the stack
	bugfix: added missing protects to SET_LENGTH calls
0.2.1: unknown (missing entry)
0.2.0: unknown (missing entry)
	introduced a C based parser for reading JSON
0.1.7: August 28, 2009
	fixed toJSON bug: named vectors are now treated as json lists
0.1.6: August 23, 2009
	fixed toJSON bug: NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf are not converted to strings
	fromJSON: null used to be returned as NA, but now is returned as NULL (but will still have the associated key displayed in the list)
