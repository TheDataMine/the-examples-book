Please follow the steps in all of the sections below, starting with `XSEDE Account`.

* Follow the https://portal.xsede.org/mfa#enroll[XSEDE Duo] setup instructions. 

== How to find my XSEDE ID

Once you've completed the two steps above you'll need to send your new XSEDE ID to The Data Mine team. Once we have your ID we will add you to our allocation on Anvil so that you can use The Data Mine's computing resources. 

If you're not sure where to find your ID, follow the steps below:

. Log-in to the https://portal.xsede.org/[XSEDE portal].
