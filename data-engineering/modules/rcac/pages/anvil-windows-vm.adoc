= Anvil Windows VM
The instructions below detail the process of setting up a Windows VM on the Brown high performance computing cluster at Purdue and linking that VM to the secured directories on Anvil. 

== Build the Windows VM
. Connect to https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/brown[Purdue's Brown HPC homepage] and select `Remote Desktop`.

Each option has a smaller button under it titled Launch, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Brown HPC Website at Purdue."]
+
. Log-in with multi-factor authentication (Duo). 
. Once the Remote Desktop session is loaded click the `Terminal Emulator` icon at the bottom of the screen.

+
. In the terminal run the command `cd /scratch/brown/<user ID>`.
** Be sure to replace the <user ID> with your ID.
** For example, I would type `cd /scratch/brown/dglass`.
. In this new directory run the command `cp /scratch/brown/dglass/windows-gis.qcow2 .`. 
** Be sure to include the period at the end of the command. 
** This is a large file so it will take 5 to 10 minutes to copy. 
. Now we have our base Windows VM. In order to use it to connect to data on Anvil we have to set up SSH keys. 

== SSH Key Configuration
. Navigate back to your Remote Desktop session (not the Windows VM). 
. In your Remote Desktop session open a new `Terminal Emulator`. 
** If you still have your terminal open you can also run `cd` to go back to your home directory.
. In the `Terminal Emulator` run `cd .ssh`.
** If this errors run `mkdir .ssh`to create your `.ssh` directory. 
** After that you can run `cd .ssh` again. 
. Once you are in the `.ssh` directory run `ssh-keygen –a 100 –t ed25519 –f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 –C “anvil_key”`
[NOTE]
====
After you run the `ssh-keygen` command above you can hit enter through all of the prompts. 

You *don't* need to set a password for the SSH key.

This command will create the SSH keys that we will use to connect to Anvil.
====
. After the `ssh-keygen` command is finished run `cat id_ed25519.pub` and copy the output. 
* We have the SSH key created! Now we need to add it to Anvil. 
. In the `Remote Desktop` session select the earth icon to open a web browser. 
+

+
. In the browser navigate to `ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu`.
** If the browser warns you of a potential security risk select `Advanced...` and then click `Accept the Risk and Continue`.
. Log-in to Anvil with your ACCESS ID and password. 
. Inside Anvil open a terminal by selecting `Clusters` and then `_Anvil Shell Access`.
image::anvil_terminal.png[The image shows a dark grey bar at the top of a web page with many options. The 4th option from the left reads "Clusters" and when hovered over shows and option for Anvil Shell Access., width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Web Browser."]
. In the terminal session run `cd .ssh`.
** If the `.ssh` directory does not exist run the `mkdir .ssh` command and then run `cd .ssh` again. 
. Inside the `.ssh` directory run `vi authorized_keys`.
. This will open up a text editor that requires specific commands to make changes:
.. In the open file type `i` to go into insert mode. This will allow you to add new text. 
.. Use `cntrl+v` to paste the SSH key that you copied from the `id_ed25519.pub` file on Brown. 
.. Be sure that the key is copied into a new line within the file. 
.. Hit the `escape` key to leave insert mode then type `:wq` to write and quite the file. 
* You can now close the browser session on Brown. 

== Connect to Anvil with the Windows VM
* Now we are on to the last step. Connecting our Windows VM on Brown to our data on Anvil. 
. In the `Remote Desktop` session on Brown select `Applications` in the upper-left, followed by `Cluster Software`, and then `Windows 10`.

+
. Once the Windows VM launched in the `Image Selection` screen select the `Saved Image` option.
