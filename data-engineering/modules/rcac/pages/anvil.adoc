= Anvil

https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil] is a great new supercomputer that was funded by the National Science Foundation. Anvil helps to expand the resources available for the NSF's https://portal.xsede.org/#/guest[Extreme Science and Egineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)]. 

Similar to Scholar and Brown, the Anvil system allows The Data Mine to run our R and Python environments on world-class research computing resources. These resources give teams access to computing power and assets like GPUs. 

== First Time Setup

If you're logging into Anvil for the first time you'll need to create an XSEDE account and send that information to The Data Mine staff. Please follow the instructions on the xref:data-engineering:rcac:xsede-setup.adoc[XSEDE setup page]. 

If you have any issues please contact The Data Mine at datamine@purdue.edu.
