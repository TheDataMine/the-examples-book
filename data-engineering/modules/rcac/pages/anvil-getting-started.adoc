= Getting Started with Anvil

Once you've got your xref:xsede-setup.adoc[account configured] it's time to get started using Anvil!

The steps below provide a high level overview of some of the resources that we have available at Purdue. 

== OnDemand

The OnDemand tool is an open source platform for a multitude of things. At Purdue in The Data Mine we use it to launch our Jupyter Lab sessions. 

Follow the instructions below to launch your first Jupyter Lab instance. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful when changing resources on your instance. These high performance computing resources are shared by multiple users. 

Making a very large request can have negative impacts on other users. 
====

. Open your favorite browser, we usually use Firefox (not Chrome, not Edge, and not Safari), and navigate to ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu. 
. Log-in with your XSEDE credentials that you set up previously. 
. Authenticate with Duo. 
. On the top navigation bar click "My Interactive Sessions".
. On the sessions screen be sure you to go the section for "The Data Mine" and select "Jupyter Notebook"

. In the "Allocation" field be sure to enter `cis220051` to use The Data Mine's resources. 
. Most of the time you'll use the default settings, but you can also change "Time in Hours" and "Memory" if needed and click "Launch".

[TIP]
====
Pay careful attention to your time remaining once the cluster has started. 

Once the time runs out the session will end and you cannot save any new changes.

== Helpful Tips
* It is helpful to create a symlink to your team's folder in Jupyter Lab. 
** To do this, open a cell in Jupyter Lab, and type this code exactly (be sure to check it carefully, including the spaces). 
** *NOTE* You only need to run this command one time (ever)! If you run it more than once Anvil will get angry.
