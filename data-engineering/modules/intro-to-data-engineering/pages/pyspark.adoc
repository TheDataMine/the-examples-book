== What is Spark?
Apache Spark is an open-source big data processing framework that enables distributed processing of large datasets across a cluster of computers.

Apache Spark is designed to be fast and efficient, with a focus on in-memory data processing. It supports various programming languages, including Java, Scala, Python, and R, and provides a set of high-level APIs for batch processing, real-time stream processing, and machine learning.

Spark uses a distributed computing model to process data, which means that data is processed in parallel across a cluster of machines. This makes it highly scalable and capable of handling large volumes of data. Spark's processing engine consists of a core engine that provides basic data processing functionality and a set of libraries, including Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib (machine learning library), and GraphX (graph processing library).

== What is PySpark?
PySpark is a Spark API that allows you to interact with Spark through the Python shell. PySpark is a particularly flexible tool for exploratory big data analysis because it integrates with the rest of the Python data analysis ecosystem, including pandas , NumPy , and Matplotlib.

Spark basically written in Scala and later on due to its industry adaptation itâ€™s API PySpark released for Python using Py4J. Py4J is a Java library that is integrated within PySpark and allows python to dynamically interface with JVM objects, hence to run PySpark you also need Java to be installed along with Python, and Apache Spark.

== Reasons to choose PySpark over pandas
* PySpark is a general-purpose, in-memory, distributed processing engine that allows you to process data efficiently in a distributed fashion.
* Applications running on PySpark are 100x faster than traditional systems.
* Using PySpark we can process data from Hadoop HDFS, AWS S3, and many file systems.
* PySpark is also used to process real-time data using Streaming and Kafka.
* PySpark natively has machine learning and graph libraries.
* PySpark provides a variety of methods for data processing along with methods to convert PySpark DataFrame to Pandas Dataframe and vice-versa.
