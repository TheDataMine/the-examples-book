= Data Engineering

Data engineering is the process to build and improve the framework that allows companies to access data and develop analytics. Like data science, data engineering is a broad topic that can cover anything from building a data lake to productionizing predictive models. 

Even though we primarily focus on data science, data engineering is a key part of what we do at The Data Mine. We included a few topics that we focus on below:
