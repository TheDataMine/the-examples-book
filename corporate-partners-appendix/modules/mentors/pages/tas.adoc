= Engaging with Your TA

Effective engagement with your TA may prove to be a key contributor to the success of your project. In this section, we'll review some strategies and guiding questions that will help mentors tailor their interactions with TAs to their wants and needs.

== Summer
=== TA Introduction
Introductions between TAs and mentors will begin mid June and continue throughout the summer. 

The Data Mine staff will extend an initial introduction via email, and it is recommended to schedule a virtual meeting with your TA as early as possible. This first meeting is a great time to introduce yourself, your company, and your project(s) with The Data Mine.

=== Setting Expectations
- What specific responsibilities do you want your TA to focus on for your project? (i.e. Scrum Master, Project Manager, Technical Lead)
- How often do you want check ins or updates from you TA?
- What from you company can you train your TA on so they can pass on their learnings to the team? (i.e Company Culture, Technical Skills, Internal documentation) 
- How can your TA create a bridge from the student team to CP mentors?

=== Summer Planning

It is encouraged that mentors and TAs use the summer months to prepare for the academic year. As soon as the fall semester starts, students are eager for their projects and to begin exploring. 

During the summer months, mentors and TAs should consider planning all components of the xref:projectcharter.adoc[project charter]:

- Semester and Project Goals
- Schedule and Checkpoints
- Team Composition and Roles
- Preparatory Readings and Exercises
- Tools and Software
- Data Sharing and Access
- Scrum and Agile Trainings

== Fall
=== Scrum and Agile
Once the academic year starts, the roles of mentors and TAs shift away from planning and towards implementing and project development. Specifically, teams will function as scrum teams with mentors playing the role of xref:agile/roles.adoc[Product owners] and TAs as xref:agile/roles.adoc[scrum master].
