= Mentoring Best Practices & Team Environment

Our students thrive with the help of an engaging mentor. This mentor does not have to be a data scientist, but we encourage this individual to be attentive and support the students the best they can. Past corporate partner mentors have served as the domain expert, technical expert, or both!
