= Dashboarding Tools

As analytics become more widespread many applications have been built to make visualization and analysis of data easier. 

Two of the most common of these applications are https://www.tableau.com/[Tableau] and https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/[Power BI].

These tools often come up as Data Mine projects progress. As with any tools they have their pros and cons. 

The Data Mine team created a simple list below to help think through use cases when designing your TDM project. 

== Power BI
* Currently there is no Linux version of this application. 
** This isn't impactful on a Windows or Mac computer, but everything on https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil] runs on Linux. 
** This means that if you'd like to use Power BI with secure data storage The Data Mine team will need to work with you in advance to setup a Windows server or VM solution. 
* Licensing:
** Power BI Desktop is free to anyone.
** Power BI Pro and Premium are paid licenses. These are required for users to publish dashboards or share Power BI workspaces. 
** Microsoft has a helpful https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports[collaboration guide] when researching different alternatives.
** There is also a https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/[product comparison] guide to help with the differences between the license levels.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Data Mine doesn't currently pay for software licenses for student teams. 

This means that the Power BI Desktop version would be available, but Pro and Premium would need to be part of the project costs for the company.

* Security:
** Security for the Power BI dashboards depends on where and how they are published. 
** Shared workspaces have different permissions levels that can be granted to users. 
** Other options publish the dashboard with no security at all. 

== Tableau
* Similar to Power BI, this does not have a Linux alternative. 
** This isn't impactful on a Windows or Mac computer, but everything on https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil] runs on Linux. 
** This means that if you'd like to use Tableau with secure data storage The Data Mine team will need to work with you in advance to setup a Windows server or VM solution. 
* Licensing:

== Alternatives
* One of the big pros of using tools like Tableau and Power BI is that they make visualization and publication easy once the pieces are in place. 
* There are tools that are open source, but they trade high levels or customization for harder implementation. 
* A few of these potential alternatives are included below:
** https://www.djangoproject.com/[Python Django]
** https://plotly.com/dash/[Python Dash]
** https://shiny.rstudio.com/[R Shiny]
