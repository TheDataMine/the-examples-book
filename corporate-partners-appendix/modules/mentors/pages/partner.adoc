== 2. Submit a Project Description 

The description outlines the who, what, how, and why of your envisioned project. Ultimately, it helps The Data Mine students select the Corportate Partners project that is right for them.

* March 31 – Project Descriptions Due

* April 14 – Late Deadline for Project Descriptions 
** Submitting your project description by this date allows students first to register (typically upper-classmen) a chance to choose your project

== 3. Review Legal & Funding

Let's make this official. Corporate Partners will review and sign this Sponsor Acknowledgment link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/corporate/sponsoracknowledgment.docx[(click here to download)]. Funding levels are listed in the Sponsor Acknowledgment. 

* Returning Corporate Parners - Partners who have signed a Sponsor Acknowledgment within the last 5 years can simply sign a new Addendum link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/corporate/addendum.docx[(click here to download)]

* July 21 - Sponsorship acknowledgements fully executed 

Additional documents to consider: 

* Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) - Most of Corporare Partners require students and staff to sign a NDA. 
* Intellectual property agreement (IP) - Students can be required to sign an IP agreement for project work.

== 4. Summer Planning 

Regular meetings with The Data Mine Corporate Parters team in the summer will prepare you as a Corporate Partner Mentor to work effectively with your student project team. Visit the xref:summerchecklist.adoc[Summer Checklist] page for a readiness checklist. 

== 5. Renewal

We look forward to building lasting relationships with you, our Corporate Partners, and fostering a deep connection over years of partnering together. The renewal process for the next academic year (August - May) starts in January, but please note that we are delighted to discuss additional projects at any time. 

We strive to build a welcoming environment to execute our mission - Data Science for All. Our Corporate Partners are a vital part of this. Thank you for partnering with The Data Mine!
