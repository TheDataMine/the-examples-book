== 3. Review Legal & Funding

Additional documents to consider:

== 4. Summer Planning 

Regular meetings with The Data Mine Corporate Parters team in the summer will prepare you as a Corporate Partner Mentor to work effectively with your student project team. Visit the xref:summerchecklist.adoc[Summer Checklist] page for a readiness checklist. 

== 5. Renewal

We look forward to building lasting relationships with you, our Corporate Partners, and fostering a deep connection over years of partnering together.

We strive to build a welcoming environment to execute our mission - Data Science for All. Our Corporate Partners are a vital part of this. Thank you for partnering with The Data Mine!
