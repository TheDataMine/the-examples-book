= Semester Logistics and Guidelines

The Data Mine Corporate Partners Program has continued to grow thanks to wonderful partners!

As our program continues to grow, we continue to make changes to automate processes and complete work efficiently. Below you will find some of the changes for Fall 2022 and why we have decided to make the changes. 

== MS Teams
Teams will be moving from Slack to MS Teams.

=== Why?
We have decided to make this move for a few reasons.

1. Condense platforms! After testing, our team has found Teams offers many tools in one place. This makes managing platforms simpler for students, TAs, and hopefully you. MS Teams can host meetings, files, a team calendar, notebooks, live coding sessions, links to The Examples Book and assignments, task dashboard(s), and so many more features. 
2. It simplifies the process of adding students to the respective projects they are enrolled in. Automating the team initialization is super important to us as we expand. The team can not add 900 students to their teams by hand. Using scripts, we are also able to automate member role management so students do not have to be moved from one team to another by hand.
3. MS Teams also creates email lists which we can use to send things to an entire team. The Data Mine Team had to create each email list and manage student roles as they switched teams, dropped the course, or joined a team later in the registration period. 
4. Another positive of moving to MS Teams is being able to see a list of team members. This can also act as the team roster once registration is closed (teams could continue changing). You can view this by selecting the following: (i) clicking on your team (ii) selecting the 3 dots next to the *team name* (iii) selecting manage team (iv) clicking on the Members and guests drop down. Here you can see the student names, emails, and role on the team as "member." 

== NDA Signing Process
The NDA signing process takes about 1-2 weeks. This Fall we have decided to have students put pen to a physical NDA during their first or second in-person lab.

Please be patient with us as we make sure students have completed their NDA to access your data. 

=== Why?

1. There are a lot of students in many lab sections across the week at two different buildings on the Purdue campus. 
2. Students may drop or add your project any time in the registration period. We have to make sure students complete the NDA to access your data. 
3. We decided to make it physical pen to paper to reiterate how important signing an NDA is. 

== Data Sharing
We strongly encourage you to *NOT* share your data the first or second week of the semester. 

=== Why?
You may be super excited to share your data with students. Students are just as excited to dive into the data. We recommend NOT sharing your data for the following reasons. 

1. We want to make sure NDAs are signed before data is shared. 
2. Students often get lost in the data especially if they do not fully understand the project scope. 

=== What should I do instead?
We strongly encourage you to *DO* the following.

1. Get to know your team! It is really helpful to know each member on your team. Get to know what drives them, what kind of support they may need, learn about their experiences. Mentoring is a two way street; maybe you can learn something new from your team. 
2. Focus on the project scope and make sure everyone understands what is being asked. This will help keep the project on track. One way to make sure all student understand is by asking everyone to describe your team project in two sentences or less in their own words. This can help you, as a mentor, identify what students think is important about your project and areas that may be over looked. 
3. Domain/background. Students are different ages with different experiences. Providing readings or topics of research will help the students better understand the project scope or process. This step is valuable when you publish as well. Students can document what they learn in their bi-weekly documentation assignment. 
4. Outline the processes or tools your team is interested in using. Then when the team dives into the data there is already a plan in place. The students should also add the process and tools to the documentation they complete. 

== Meeting Attendance
Please please please remember to block your meeting time on your schedule weekly. 
Mentors have a 50 minute meeting with their team each week to complete Sprint Planning or a Sprint Review. These are great opportunities to learn about what the team has completed or cover anything with the team as a whole. We want to make sure our wonderful mentor, you, are there to provide guidance, domain expertise, and feedback on your project's progress. 
It is recommended to book a full hour for this meeting in case there are questions at the end or the meeting runs a little late.
