= Sprints

*Sprints* are the building blocks of development under Scrum. They are short, time specific periods where a team works to accomplish specific work and goals. In general, there are four key ceremonies that make up sprints: sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. 

== Sprints in The Data Mine

Within The Data Mine, two-week sprints are generally most appropriate. Sprints can be aligned with bi-weekly progress reports, so teams are sharing updates with TAs and The Data Mine staff while they work within the sprint schedule. Teams will structure these two-week sprints so that team meetings align with the 4 sprint ceremonies.
