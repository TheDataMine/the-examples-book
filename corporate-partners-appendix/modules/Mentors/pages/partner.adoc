Whether this is your first introduction to The Data Mine or you are a dear friend. We look forward to talking in more detail with you during a 25-minute call. 

You are welcome to schedule a call with us on link:https://calendly.com/datamine[our Calendly page] or email us at datamine@purdue.edu


== 2. Project Description 

You can find the  xref:project_descriptions.adoc[project description guidelines], to help you define your customized project. 

== 3. Legal & Funding

Our industry partners sign this Sponsor Acknowledgment link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/corporate/sponsoracknowledgment.docx[(click here to download)]. Most of our partners require students and staff to sign a NDA. As an additional option students can be required to sign an IP agreement. Funding levels are listed in the Sponsor Acknowledgment.  Partners who already signed a Sponsor Acknowledgment within the last 5 years can simplify things by just signing a new Addendum link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/corporate/addendum.docx[(click here to download)]
