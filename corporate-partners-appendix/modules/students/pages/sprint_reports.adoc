# Sprint Reports

The success of this project depends on your presence, collaboration, and contribution. The Sprint Report gives you the opportunity to reflect on the **last sprint (the past two weeks)**, explain your role in the project's progress, and demonstrate the contributions that earn your sprint grade portion.

TIP: Sprint Reports are submitted bi-weekly on link:https://gradescope.com/[Gradescope].

_Anytime you copy and paste something you did not write (from a peer, AI, or otherwise); it is considered plagiarism and falls under academic dishonesty._

## Presence (20 points)
_Presence is a consistent participation and engagement in project meetings (Team Meetings and Labs) — being on time, attentive, and actively involved in discussions so the team and mentors can rely on you._

|===
| Unsatisfactory (50%) | Below Expectations (70%) | Needs Improvement (85%) | Meets Expectations (95%) | Exceeds Expectations (100%)
| Missed three or all meetings (Team Meetings and Labs). | Missed two meetings or does not engage. | Missed a meeting, does not use Camera, or lacks participation in meetings. | Attended all scheduled meetings. Camera was on and participated actively in meetings. | Attended all scheduled meetings. Camera was on, participated in meetings and often led discussions, and demonstrates out of the box thinking. Works with peers outside of schedule class time.
|===

**Example "Exceeds Expectations" presence justification:** _"I chose Exceeds Expectations because I attended all LEC and LAB meetings and stayed engaged by keeping my devices off unless needed. I participated actively by leading a Week 3 lab brainstorming session on schema design and collaborated outside class with Tom and Sarah in a scheduled Friday meeting to plan our task. Additionally, I contributed on MSTeams by clarifying design doubts and sharing inputs."_

## Contributions (20 points x2)

_Contributions are the individual work you produced (e.g., deliverables, code, documentation) that moved the project forward._
|===
| Unsatisfactory (50%) | Below Expectations (70%) | Needs Improvement (85%) | Meets Expectations (95%) | Exceeds Expectations (100%)
| Little-to-no evidence of effort. | Disorganized and task was unclear, very behind schedule, or little evidence of effort. | Task was unclear, may have been behind schedule, lacked organization or was difficult to follow, with some evidence of effort and self-improvement. | Understood the task, was on-schedule, work was clean and organized, and there was sufficient evidence of effort and self-improvement. | Demonstrated exceptional understanding of the task, managed time effectively, produced professional and well-organized work, and provided outstanding evidence of effort and self-improvement.

**Example "Exceeds Expectations" contribution justification:** _"I chose Exceeds Expectations because I spent dedicated time on the project charter, analyzing each section and asking clarifying questions with my TA or mentor. I submitted my notes document on time, kept it professional and well-organized, and reflected on what I learned during the lab session."_

## Collaboration (20 points)
_Collaboration is how you worked with others in meetings, on MSTeams, and outside of class — sharing progress, keeping the Kanban board updated, communicating promptly, creating documentation others can follow, and supporting your teammates._

|===
| Unsatisfactory (50%) | Below Expectations (70%) | Needs Improvement (85%) | Meets Expectations (95%) | Exceeds Expectations (100%)
| Lacked engagement with peers, did not communicate adequately in meetings or on MSTeams. | Kanban board was not updated with progress, responses in MSTeams or meetings were often unresponsive, or documentation was absent. | Kanban board updates were inconsistent, participation in meetings was limited, responses on MSTeams were delayed, and documentation was incomplete. | Maintained the Kanban board, participated in meetings, communicated on MSTeams in a timely manner, created documentation, worked well with peers, and reached out when stuck.| Maintained the Kanban board consistently, contributed actively in meetings, communicated promptly on MSTeams, created thorough documentation, exhibited leadership skills, and supported peers.

**Example "Exceeds Expectations" collaboration justification:**  _"I chose Exceeds Expectations because I consistently updated the Kanban board after finishing tasks and kept it up to date for meetings. I contributed actively in mentor meetings by asking clarifying questions (for example, about how tables in the database schema should connect) and helping guide discussions. On MSTeams, I responded promptly to Sarah's questions, explained our schema design approach, reacted quickly to TA messages, and created thorough documentation so the team could build on my work."_

## Reflection (20 points)
*There are three questions in this section, answer 2 out of 3 questions for full credit.*

These are rotating questions that relate back to the learning objectives of The Data Mine. They also may include questions to gather timely feedback about the program or its people.
