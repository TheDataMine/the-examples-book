When you register for a Corporate Partners Project, you will automatically be added to a MS Teams channel for that project. It may take about a day to register on the back end so please be patient. If you do not get added after 24 hours, please submit a ticket to datamine-help@purdue.edu.

Once you are in the MS Team channel, you will also be included in an Outlook email group. This email group keeps the history of all emails exchanged from the associated email group.
