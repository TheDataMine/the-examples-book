== Dress Code for Meetings with Guests and Site Visits 

At a _minimum_, students should dress to Level 5 - Baseline Casual (see image below) for meetings with guests and Corporate Partner Mentors on site. 

If a higher dress code is warranted, we will let you know in the invitation of the meeting. 

You should *not* wear the following when we have visitors:

- pajamas
- sweat pants 
- leggings
- crop tops 
- slippers 
- ripped or dirty jeans
