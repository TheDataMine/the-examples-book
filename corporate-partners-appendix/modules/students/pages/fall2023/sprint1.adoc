= Sprint #1

== Sprint Dates
All sprints will have the same due dates, but the sprint start and end dates are slightly shifted depending on when a team has their lab (2 hours) and lecture (50 minutes). This is so that sprints always start with a lec and follow the format lec-lab-lec-lab.

You can find a xref:agile:ceremonies.adoc#sprint-schedule[visual of the sprint schedule in the Agile Training Ceremonies page]. More details will be covered in the agile training below.
