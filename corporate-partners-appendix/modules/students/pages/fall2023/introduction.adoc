= Welcome to The Data Mine Corporate Partners Fall 2023 semester!

All course content lives within The Corporate Partners appendix of The Example Book (the pages you are reading right now). 

However, we still have a link:https://purdue.brightspace.com/[Brightspace] page for the purposes of grading. All Purdue courses are required to post grades in Brightspace. Students will also use link:https://www.gradescope.com/[Gradescope] as the submission portal for assignments.  


To get started this semester:

1. Watch this link:https://youtu.be/HesN2alnkuk["first day of class" video].

2. Review the xref:fall2023/syllabus.adoc[fall 2023 syllabus].

3. Review the xref:fall2023/schedule.adoc[fall 2023 course schedule] for due dates and important dates.

4. Confirm your xref:fall2023/locations.adoc[meeting time and location]. This should match the time listed on your official Purdue schedule. The MS Teams meeting link for your SYNC ONLINE class will be sent a few days before August 21. If you do not have this meeting link, please email us at datamine-help@purdue.edu and specify what team you are on. 

5. Click on xref:fall2023/sprint1.adoc[Sprint #1] to review the content for the first two weeks.

We look forward to working with you this semester!
