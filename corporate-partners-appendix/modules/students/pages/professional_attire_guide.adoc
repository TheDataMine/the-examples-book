First impressions matter – a lot! You only get one shot to make a first impression. While the studies don't agree on one specific number – they all agree that you have less than 30 seconds to impress someone. Some studies even state that you have only seven seconds before someone makes a judgement.

== Dress Code for Meetings with Guests and Site Visits 

Now that you've learned about different levels of professional attire, let's define expectations for meetings with visitors and site visits. 

At a _minimum_, students should dress to baseline/smart casual for meetings with guests and Corporate Partner Mentors on-site. 

If a higher dress code is warranted, we will let you know in the invitation of the meeting. 

Unsure of the attire expectations? Ask the meeting scheduler to clarify. 

You should *not* wear the following when we have guests or site visits:

- pajamas
- sweat pants 
- leggings
- crop tops 
- slippers 
- ripped or dirty jeans
