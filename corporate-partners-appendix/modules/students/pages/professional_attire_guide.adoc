== CCO Career Closet
Purdue's https://www.cco.purdue.edu/Students/WhatWeOffer?tab=CareerCloset[CCO Career Closet] offers professional attire to students for interviews and job fairs as a lot of students come to campus without these items and/or may not be able to afford them.  The Career Closet provides a free service for these students where they can schedule an appointment with us and take up to one full professional outfit per academic year.

Navigate to the CCO Career Closet page to learn about the JCPenney Suit-Up Event where you can access discounts and save on careerwear, shoes, and accessories for a limited time this Fall. 

Days and Hours Open: Only during appointment hours, usually Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during the academic year.  Use BoilerConnect to see the most accurate appointment availability.

=== FAQ
* Do students have to return the clothing? No, items are theirs to keep at no charge.
* Who operates the closet on a day to day basis? The Career Closet Intern and Student Peer Assistants assist students in need with finding items in their size and showing them the dressing room. Additionally, Career Closet Intern and Career Closet Coordinator (staff member); Career Closet Intern sorts through the donations and organize them according to size and item type.
