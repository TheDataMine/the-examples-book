= Microsoft Teams 

The Data Mine uses Microsoft Team for team communication and collaboration. The Microsoft suite of applications is free for all students. The Data Mine will use MS Teams as mode of chatting as well as video calls for online meetings with mentors.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The process to update Purdue's systems and sync with Teams when changing a course can take 24 to 48 hrs. 

After your course is changed, please wait 48 hrs. to see if you are automatically added to the correct Teams group. 

If you don't see the correct Teams group after 48 hrs., please email datamine-help@purdue.edu

You can download Microsoft Teams for your phone or desktop at this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app[link]. 

== Log In

Log in using your base Purdue login credentials, or if you are a National Data Mine Network or Indiana Data Mine student, use your university login credentials. You do not need to use your duo two-factor authentication login.

The call information for your virtual 50-minute (LEC) team meeting (and online lab if applicable for NDMN) are pinned in the MS Teams chat. You can access the pinned message by clicking on the "i" for information in the top right of the _General_ channel.

=== Accessing your Teams Group
When you register for a Corporate Partners Project, you will automatically be added to a MS Teams channel for that project. It may take about a day to register on the back end so please be patient. If you do not get added after 36 hours, please submit a ticket to datamine-help@purdue.edu.

Once you are in the MS Team channel, you will also be included in an Outlook email group. This email group keeps the history of _all_ emails exchanged from the associated email group. 

[NOTE]
====
Sending or replying to any message in this group will send it to the entire team.
