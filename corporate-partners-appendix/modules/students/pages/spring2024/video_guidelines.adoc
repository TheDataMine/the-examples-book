= Video Deliverables 

[IMPORTANT]
====
These posters and videos will be shared *publicly* during the Symposium. It is essential that students Work closely with their Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared without violating any NDAs. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium. 
====

// * _[Per Team]_ One 5-8 minute long *video*   
** The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
** You are encouraged to include demonstrations of your developments (like an interactive app).   

== Expectations

* *All students must contribute to the poster and video, but likely in different roles.*
* Here are some examples of different roles the students can fill(as well as added suggestions): 

** One student can take the poster content and translate it to PowerPoint slides. It is recommended that you add more visuals to your slides and please do not make them text heavy.  
** One student can write the script for the video. Make sure to practice reading it to ensure it fits within the required time. 
** One student can create the recording and voice over 
** One student can do any necessary editing and add the closed captions.  
* *Work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared*. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium. 

== Due Dates

[TIP]
====
*Drafts* of the poster and video due *Wednesday, March 6, 2024*. 

*Final versions* of the poster and video due *Wednesday, April 3, 2024*.

====

A submitted *video draft* includes slides and a completed initial recording. Captioning is not required for the draft. TAs will submit the drafts (one per team).

== Examples
The Data Mine had a virtual symposium in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Please note we had fewer Corporate Partner teams in 2020 & 2021.  It would be helpful to watch some of the videos and review the posters from link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2020.html[2019-2020], link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2021.html[2020-2021], and link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2022.html[2021-22].

== Create your video 

// * The video should be 5-8 minutes long. 
// * The video should be 3-5 minutes long. 
* The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. 
* _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
* You are encouraged to include demonstrations of your developments (like an interactive app). 

[TIP]
====
We encourage *creativity* when creating your video! Please don't feel obligated to make a standard PowerPoint video. The link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/corporate/merck/[Merck videos from 2021] (specifically the biometrics team) did a great job of making a unique video. 
====


==  Transfer your poster content to slides

* *Take the same content (words and visuals) from your finished poster and transfer them to PowerPoint slides.*
* xref:attachment$Purdue-branded-powerpoint-template-reduced.pptx[Click here to download] a Purdue Data Mine branded PowerPoint slide deck (1.6 MB). You do not have to use these slides. 
* The slides don’t have to match up word for word as the poster, but do not feel that you need to create new content. If anything, your slides will be briefer than your poster. *Make sure your slides tell a story.*
* Make sure each slide isn’t too text heavy. *Add a relevant visual on every slide if possible.*
* Allow time at the end of your slides for any interactive visualizations you plan to show. You can also make a separate video for your app demonstrations. 

== Make a transcript for your recording
* It is strongly recommended that you make notes for your video. *DO NOT STRICTLY READ OFF YOUR NOTES.* This makes for a boring video. 
* Practice delivering the information for each slide so it falls within the required time frame. You could write your script in the “Notes” box under each slide.

* This will make future recordings as consistent as possible. After, the legal review and draft, you may need
to record your video again.
* It is easier to add closed captioning with notes. 

== Record your video

There are a variety of ways to create your video recording. Here are some options:

* Record link:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c[audio for each slide] and link:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83[export the PowerPoint as a video].
** This works exceptionally well and is very simple. If you have an app demonstration, you
can use a screen recording tool above to make two separate videos (PowerPoint and
demo) or stitch them together in an editor.
* Record your entire screen or selected portion of your screen link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721[on your Mac].

==  Add ADA Closed Captions

* You are required to add closed captioning to your video on YouTube. 
* CC’s should be added to the draft and final video
