== 3 Minute Thesis

Imagine you have just 180 seconds to explain your complex research and project work
your team as completed since the beginning of term… but you can only use one slide
and leave out any technical jargon. That's the whole idea of the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT)

** The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
** You are encouraged to include demonstrations of your developments (like an interactive app).   

== Guidelines for the 3MT

* You must use a single static PowerPoint slide with no transitions or animations.
** You cannot your poster as the slide.
* You are limited to 3 minutes maximum.
** 2 minute minimum.
* Presentations are to be spoken word (e.g. no poems, raps or songs)

== What is The Three Minute Thesis (3MT(R))?

The Three Minute Thesis serves as an annual public speaking competition, inviting
researchers to succinctly articulate the impact and breadth of their research within a 3-
minute timeframe, targeting a non-specialist audience. Originating from the University
of Queensland in 2008, this innovative contest has rapidly expanded its reach, now
captivating audiences in over 85 countries worldwide!
