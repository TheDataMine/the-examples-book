= Welcome to The Data Mine Corporate Partners Spring 2023 semester!

All course content lives within The Corporate Partners appendix of The Example Book (the pages you are reading right now).

However, we still have a link:https://purdue.brightspace.com/[Brightspace] page for the purposes of grading. All Purdue courses are required to post grades in Brightspace. Students will also continue to use link:https://www.gradescope.com/[Gradescope] as the submission portal for sprint reports. The method of submission will be specified for each assignment under the corresponding sprint page. 

To get started this semester:

1. Review the xref:spring2023/syllabus.adoc[spring 2023 syllabus].

2. Review the xref:spring2023/schedule.adoc[spring 2023 course schedule] for due dates and important dates.

3. Confirm your xref:spring2023/locations.adoc[meeting time and location]. This should match the time listed on your official Purdue schedule. The MS Teams meeting link for your SYNC ONLINE class will be emailed out. If you do not have this meeting link by Sunday, January 8, 2023, please email us at datamine-help@purdue.edu _and_ specify what team you are on. 

4. Click on xref:spring2023/sprint1.adoc[Sprint #1] to review the content for the first two weeks.

We look forward to working with you this semester!
