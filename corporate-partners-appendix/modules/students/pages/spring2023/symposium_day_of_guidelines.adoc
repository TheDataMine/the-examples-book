We encourage you to establish roles within your team for the in-person poster session. Please discuss with your team members to establish roles. Everyone should be actively participating in the Q&A. Here are some potential roles:

*Welcomer:* Welcomes new people as they observe your poster (if not interrupting a discussion).  If nobody is asking questions, this person can also be ready to give a short 1-2 minute “elevator pitch” about the project to motivate means for conversation.  You don’t have to re-present the whole poster and video, but not everybody will have watched your video ahead of time.  

*Subcategory answerers/subject matter experts:*  Your team can decide who is best suited to answer certain types of questions. Decide on these categories and who should be in each one ahead of time.  Consider these to be “subject matter experts” for specialties. 

*Think of questions for your guests!*  Hopefully you will have great conversation with many quests.  Some will be Purdue faculty/staff/students.  Some will be your Corporate Partners mentors or people from their companies.  Some will be guests from other companies.  If you have answered all of their questions, it’s ok to ask them questions about themselves, too.  Who are they?  Where do they work?  What do they do?  Why are they excited about data science?  What do they recommend for you to do to get ready have a career in data science?  (Think of those extra questions for the speakers we have you write about in the Outside Event reflections.)  This could be a great opportunity for you to meet some really interesting people!
