== Sprint Schedule

All sprints will have the same due dates, but you will see below that the sprint start and end dates are slightly shifted depending on when a team has their lab (2 hours) and lecture (50 minutes). 

This is so that sprints always start with a lec and follow the format lec-lab-lec-lab.

A visual of this schedule is available in the xref:agile:ceremonies.adoc#sprint-schedule[Agile training section on ceremonies].
