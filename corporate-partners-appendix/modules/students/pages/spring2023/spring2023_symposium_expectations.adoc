=== Roles

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not necessary for each person on the team to attend for the full symposium. Rather, each poster should have 3 students present at all times. *Teams should plan 30 minute shifts in advance of the symposium.*
====

We encourage you to establish roles within your team for the in-person poster session. Please discuss with your team members to establish roles. Everyone should be actively participating in the Q&A. Here are some potential roles:

*Welcomer:* Welcomes new people as they observe your poster (if not interrupting a discussion).  If nobody is asking questions, this person can also be ready to give a short 1-2 minute “elevator pitch” about the project to motivate means for conversation.  You don’t have to re-present the whole poster and video, but not everybody will have watched your video ahead of time.  

*Subcategory answerers/subject matter experts:*  Your team can decide who is best suited to answer certain types of questions. Decide on these categories and who should be in each one ahead of time.  Consider these to be “subject matter experts” for specialties. 

*Think of questions for your guests!*  Hopefully you will have great conversation with many quests.  Some will be Purdue faculty/staff/students.  Some will be your Corporate Partners mentors or people from their companies.  Some will be guests from other companies.  If you have answered all of their questions, it’s ok to ask them questions about themselves, too.  Who are they?  Where do they work?  What do they do?  Why are they excited about data science?  What do they recommend for you to do to get ready have a career in data science?  (Think of those extra questions for the speakers we have you write about in the Outside Event reflections.)  This could be a great opportunity for you to meet some really interesting people!

== Deliverables 

[IMPORTANT]
====
These posters and videos will be shared *publicly* during the Symposium. It is essential that students Work closely with their Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared without violating any NDAs. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium. 
====

* _[Per Team]_ One 3 x 4 feet *poster* submitted as a PDF. 
** Subteams should work together to make one poster. 
** _It is imperative that you work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared._
* _[Per Team]_ One 5-8 minute long *video*   
** The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
** You are encouraged to include demonstrations of your developments (like an interactive app).   

=== Expectations

* *All students must contribute to the poster and video, but likely in different roles.*
* Here are some examples of different roles the students can fill(as well as added suggestions): 

** One student can take the poster content and translate it to PowerPoint slides. It is recommended that you add more visuals to your slides and please do not make them text heavy.  
** One student can write the script for the video. Make sure to practice reading it to ensure it fits within the required time. 
** One student can create the recording and voice over 
** One student can do any necessary editing and add the closed captions.  
* *Work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared*. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium. 

=== Due Dates

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Drafts* of the poster and video due *Wednesday, March 8, 2023*. 

*Final versions* of the poster and video due *Wednesday, April 5, 2023*.

====

A submitted *poster draft* should be at least 75% complete. Any sections without content/visuals should contain notes of what will be added. A submitted *video draft* includes slides and a completed initial recording. Captioning is not required for the draft. TAs will submit the drafts (one per team).

=== Examples
The Data Mine had a virtual symposium in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Please note we had fewer Corporate Partner teams in 2020 & 2021.  It would be helpful to watch some of the videos and review the posters from link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2020.html[2019-2020], link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2021.html[2020-2021], and link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2022.html[2021-22].

== Create your poster

* Create your poster outline in PowerPoint and save it in the general channel of your MS Teams group
* *Your poster should not be text heavy* -- it is not a paper, so complete sentences should be limited. Make sure to include multiple visuals and keep sentences to a minimum. Bullet points are encouraged.    
* Make sure to include all of these categories:

[cols="3,5"]
|===

|*Introduction/Background/Motivation* |• We recommend looking back at the project description and materials shared during the first weeks of the fall semester. This will be a great resource to find introduction and background material and wording.
|*Research Methodology* |• The “how” of your research
|*Conclusions* |• What are your big picture findings? 
|*Future Goals* | • What are next steps if you had more time to continue? 
|*References & Acknowledgements* | • Thank your CRP Mentors, any faculty mentors, and others that helped on the project.

• Cite your sources! There may be too many to include, but list a few
*key* sources. 
|*Figures* | • Make sure to include relevant visuals
|*Layout & Design* | • Keep font and colors consistent.

• Make sure it is visually appealing. Zoom out and make the entire poster shows on your screen. What do you notice about it? Is it full of text? Too much white space? Not enough images? Flow is confusing?

== Create your video 

* The video should be 5-8 minutes long. 
* The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. 
* _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
* You are encouraged to include demonstrations of your developments (like an interactive app). 

[TIP]
====
We encourage *creativity* when creating your video! Please don't feel obligated to make a standard PowerPoint video. The link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/corporate/merck/[Merck videos from 2021] (specifically the biometrics team) did a great job of making a unique video. 
====


===  Transfer your poster content to slides

* *Take the same content (words and visuals) from your finished poster and transfer them to PowerPoint slides.*
* xref:attachment$Purdue-branded-powerpoint-template-reduced.pptx[Click here to download] a Purdue Data Mine branded PowerPoint slide deck (1.6 MB). You do not have to use these slides. 
* The slides don’t have to match up word for word as the poster, but do not feel that you need to create new content. If anything, your slides will be briefer than your poster. *Make sure your slides tell a story.*
* Make sure each slide isn’t too text heavy. *Add a relevant visual on every slide if possible.*
* Allow time at the end of your slides for any interactive visualizations you plan to show. You can also make a separate video for your app demonstrations. 

=== Make a transcript for your recording
* It is strongly recommended that you make notes for your video. *DO NOT STRICTLY READ OFF YOUR NOTES.* This makes for a boring video. 
* Practice delivering the information for each slide so it falls within the required time frame. You could write your script in the “Notes” box under each slide. 


image::symposium_powerpoint_transcript.jpg[Our image, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Screenshot of adding notes for the transcript in PowerPoint."] 

* This will make future recordings as consistent as possible. After, the legal review and draft, you may need
to record your video again.
* It is easier to add closed captioning with notes. 

=== Record your video

There are a variety of ways to create your video recording. Here are some options:

* Record link:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c[audio for each slide] and link:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83[export the PowerPoint as a video].
** This works exceptionally well and is very simple. If you have an app demonstration, you
can use a screen recording tool above to make two separate videos (PowerPoint and
demo) or stitch them together in an editor.
* Record your entire screen or selected portion of your screen link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721[on your Mac].
* Record your screen in link:https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-capture-video-clips-in-windows-10[Windows 10].
* Record using link:https://obsproject.com/[OBS Studio] which is free for Windows, Mac, and Linux
* Record using link:https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder?__c=1[Apowersoft] which is an in-browser tool for free
* Record your screen on your link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935[iPad].
* [_Only recommended if multiple people will be talking in the video and option 1 above does not seem to work_] Share your screen and record in Zoom.  https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/

=== Edit your video 

* Edit your video on an as-needed basis.
* This could mean putting two audio recordings into one video or cropping out a mistake.
