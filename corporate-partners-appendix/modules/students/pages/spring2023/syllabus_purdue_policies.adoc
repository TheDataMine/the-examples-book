If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress.

=== Diversity and Inclusion Statement

In our discussions, structured and unstructured, we will explore a variety of challenging issues, which can help us enhance our understanding of different experiences and perspectives. This can be challenging, but in overcoming these challenges we find the greatest rewards. While we will design guidelines as a group, everyone should remember the following points:

•	We are all in the process of learning about others and their experiences. Please speak with me, anonymously if needed, if something has made you uncomfortable.
•	Intention and impact are not always aligned, and we should respect the impact something may have on someone even if it was not the speaker’s intention.
•	We all come to the class with a variety of experiences and a range of expertise, we should respect these in others while critically examining them in ourselves.
