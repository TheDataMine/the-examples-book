== Sprint Tasks

NOTE: The first sprint has a lot of tasks to help aide with onboarding. In future sprints, plan to spend more time working on your project.

[[onboarding]]
=== &#10003; pass:[<span style="color:#1f77b4;">New Students Onboarding</span>]

In the Corporate Partners course, we do not hold a single first class with all 800+ students, as teams begin meeting immediately. Instead, onboarding is completed asynchronously through required setup tasks and a short recorded video that covers first-day information. This includes setting up Anvil (when required) and MS Teams, which are essential tools for project work and communication.

*When:* By the first day of class

.*1. First Day of Class Video*
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* You will not have a single in-person first class because teams begin meeting immediately. This video provides the key information you need to get started in the course.

*What:* Watch the recorded {first-class} video. It was recorded in Fall {fall-year}, but all information is still relevant.
====

.*2. Anvil Access*
[%collapsible%open]
====
*_Note:_* If your Corporate Partner uses a different environment, no additional action is needed.

*Why:* Project work for Seminar and some Corporate Partners is conducted in Anvil. An ACCESS account ensures you can access the required computing environment when needed.

*What:* Create one ACCESS account to log in to Anvil by following the instructions at {anvil}. Do not repeat this step if you have already set it up for Seminar.
====

.*3. Download MS Teams*
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* The Data Mine uses MS Teams as one of our primary communication tools. You must download MS Teams to your computer. Your team **should not** use any other form of communication (e.g., Slack, Discord) unless approved by The Data Mine staff and your mentor.

*What:* Review the {ms-teams} page. Download the MS Teams Desktop App to your computer (and to your phone if you choose).
====

'''

[[pm]]
=== &#10003; Project Management Training
*Why:* The Data Mine Corporate Partners program uses Agile project management, a common industry practice. This sprint reinforces Agile concepts and emphasizes practical task management through a Kanban board used throughout the semester.

*What:* Both new and returning students should complete the {agile}. Read the {kanban-article} or watch the {kanban-video} (created using MLNotebook and based on the article) to understand how Kanban board are used within Scrum. Then complete the Project Management Quiz on Gradescope, which is divided into 5 sections:

- Agile (Scrum) Concepts
- Agile & The Data Mine Corporate Partners
- Understanding Kanban Board
- Scenarios
- Agile & Kanban Board in Practice



_Note: The term Kanban board is used to describe a Kanban-style board within a Scrum framework (often referred to as a Scrum board). You may see different terminology used, but the structure and purpose align with the Scrum-based project work used in this course._

**When:** Project Management Quiz Due on Gradescope by {pd-due}.


'''

[[quiz]]
=== &#10003; Syllabus Quiz
*Why:* This quiz focuses on shared syllabus information relevant to all Data Mine Corporate Partner students, regardless of project or mentor.

*What:* Both new and returning students should review the spring {spring-year} {syllabus} and {schedule}. Then, take the quiz up to three times; your highest score will be recorded. You may keep the syllabus open while taking the quiz.

//// 
add: .**5. Meeting Expectations**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Students in The Data Mine Corporate Partners program meet with their Corporate Partner Mentors online via Microsoft Teams every week. Conducting oneself professionally in a virtual setting is a crucial skill to develop. Returning students should reflect on their experiences from the fall {fall-year} semester, noting what went well and identifying areas for improvement. New students should familiarize themselves with the do's and don'ts of these meetings to ensure they make a positive impression

*What:* Both new and returning students should review the information and watch the video on effective participation in virtual meetings {onlinemeetings}
==== 
////

_Please note there is a separate syllabus quiz for the 1 credit seminar class (TDM 102, 202, 302, 402, 502)._

**When:** Syllabus Quiz Due on Gradescope by {pd-due}. Late work will not be accepted. 


'''

[[professional-development]]
=== &#10003; [.green]#Professional Development#
During sprint {sprint-no}, this professional development focuses on reviewing team expectations, thinking critically about the use of artificial intelligence, and completing required data handling training.

**When:** Professional Development Due on Gradescope by {pd-due}. Late work will not be accepted. 

.**1. Team Contract Review**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Team Contracts are the foundation of a successful team, helping members understand expectations, establish norms, and define accountability. During a TA-facilitated discussion, teams will review their contract to identify what is working well, what may need clarification or updates, and how accountability will be enforced if expectations are not met. New students should use this opportunity to familiarize themselves with the contract and align with their team, while returning students should reflect on its effectiveness and contribute suggestions to improve clarity and usability.

*What*: After reviewing your Team Contract and participating in the TA-facilitated discussion, complete the reflection:

- Team Contract Understanding
- Accountability & Improvements

====

.**2. Artificial Intellgence**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Generative AI tools are widely available and increasingly used in academic and professional settings. This activity is designed to help you think critically about when and how GenAI should be used as a learning support, rather than relying on it automatically.

*What:* Watch the provided video on {genai} (approximately 15 minutes). Do not use a GenAI tool to summarize the video. After watching, reflect on the questions posed and write your own thoughtful responses based on your experiences and perspectives.
====

.**3. Data Handling**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Responsible data handling is a core expectation for Data Mine students. This certification ensures you understand best practices related to data privacy, security, and ethical use of data, which are essential for academic work and Corporate Partner projects.

*What:* Complete the required data handling training based on your student status.

- *Purdue students:* Complete Purdue’s {data-purdue}. If your certification from Fall {fall-year} is still active, you may re-upload that document. Upload a screenshot showing your name and valid dates (active through at least May 1, {spring-year}).

- *National Data Mine (NDMN & IDMN) students:* Download and review {data-no-purdue}, then upload a one-paragraph PDF reflection summarizing what you learned from the training.

_Note: If you believe that data was incorrectly handled or shared, please notify datamine@purdue.edu immediately._

[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003;Sprint #{sprint-no} Report
**Why**: The Sprint Report is part of your grade and helps you reflect on your past work. It also gives you the chance to step back, recognize your impact, and track your growth as a teammate and professional.  Each section is designed to help you think about your role, your progress, and how you are applying professional skills in a real project setting.

**What**: For Sprint #{sprint-no}, your report has three parts:

- **Self-Evaluation** - evaluate your presence, contributions, and collaboration using the provided rubrics, and justify your choices.
- **Reflection** - connect your experiences from this sprint to project practices and the program.

**When:** Sprint Report #{sprint-no} Due on Gradescope by {report-due}. Late work will not be accepted.
