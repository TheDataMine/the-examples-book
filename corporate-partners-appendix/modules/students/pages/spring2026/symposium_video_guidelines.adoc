= Video Deliverables 

_Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your project._ The video doesn't have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
These posters and videos will be shared *publicly* during the Symposium. It is essential that students Work closely with their Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared without violating any NDAs. The Data Mine will send all videos to be reviewed by the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium.

== 3 Minute Thesis

The video presentation will follow the format of the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT). 

Think of the 3MT as an elevator pitch for your project. Imagine you just came out of lab, you walk into an elevator, and someone joins you and asks, "What class are you getting out of?" You say Data Mine lab, and this person asks, "Oh, tell me about the work you're doing."  You have just 180 seconds to explain the complex research and project work your team has completed since the beginning of the term. AND this person likely does not have a technical background. 

That's the whole idea of the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT), to succinctly describe a research topic in a way that engages the listener and leaves them with a better understanding of:

- ** The Why ** - why is this research important?
- ** The What ** - what is the relevant background information?
- ** The Impact ** - how does this connect back to the average person or greater society? 

== Guidelines for the 3MT

* You will made a brief PowerPoint slide deck with good transitions and animations.
* You are limited to 3 minutes maximum, and for full points should be just shy of 3 minutes.
* Recommended that your camera is on when recording your 3MT.
* Presentations are to be spoken word (e.g. no poems, raps or songs)

== Expectations

*All students must contribute to the 3MT, but likely in different roles.*

* Here are some examples of different roles the students can fill(as well as added suggestions): 

* One or more students can brainstorm ideas and bring together the storytelling presentation components. (See "How to Write a Winning 3MT Script" below)
* One student can assemble the PowerPoint slides to be used. It is recommended that you limit text and instead focus on visuals. (See "How to design and impactful 3MT slide" below)
* One or more students can write the script for the 3MT. (See "How to Write a Winning 3MT Script" below)
** Make sure to practice reading it to ensure it fits within the required time.
* One or two students can create the video recording and voice over.
* One student can do any necessary video editing and add the closed captions.
*Work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared.*
** The Data Mine will send all videos to review the company’s legal team before posting for the Symposium

== Due Dates

[TIP]
====
*Drafts* of the poster and video due *Friday, March 13, 2026*. 

*Final versions* of the poster and video due *Wednesday, April 8, 2026*.

== Rubric

The video rubric follows the same criteria as the poster rubric. In addition, The video rubric includes criteria about the speaker, the flow, and closed captioning. Video slides should be mostly bullet points and figures. Students should be speaking about the details of the project, *not just read from the slides.*

== Where did The Three Minute Thesis (3MT(R)) come from?

The Three Minute Thesis is an annual public speaking competition at many universities, inviting researchers to succinctly articulate the impact and breadth of their research within a 3-minute timeframe, targeting a non-specialist audience. Originating from the University of Queensland in 2008, this innovative contest has rapidly expanded its reach, now captivating audiences in over 85 countries worldwide!
