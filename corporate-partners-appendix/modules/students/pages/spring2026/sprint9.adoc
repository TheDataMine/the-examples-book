**What**: For Sprint #{sprint-no}, your report has three parts:

- **Self-Evaluation** - evaluate your presence, contributions, and collaboration using the provided rubrics, and justify your choices.
- **Implementation Check from Professional Development**
- **Reflection** - connect your experiences from this sprint to project practices and the program.

**When:** Sprint Report #{sprint-no} Due on Gradescope by {report-due}. Late work will not be accepted.
