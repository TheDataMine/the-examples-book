[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003;Sprint #{sprint-no} Report
**Why**: We use Qualtrics to collect final report responses so submissions can be easily organized, analyzed, and aggregated by team. This allows us to review responses efficiently and ensure all submissions are properly recorded. After submitting, you will receive a confirmation email with your responses as proof that your report was received. If you do not receive a confirmation email, your submission was not received (or your email was entered incorrectly), so please contact us.

**What**: For Sprint #{sprint-no}, share your experience in The Data Mine, provide feedback, and write your mentor(s) a thank you note via Qualtrics. You will be graded on effort and completion. Honesty is appreciated so we can continue to improve The Data Mine Corporate Partners. 

**When:** Sprint Report #{sprint-no} Due on Gradescope by {report-due}. Late work will not be accepted.
