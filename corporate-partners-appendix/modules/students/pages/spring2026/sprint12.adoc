[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003;Sprint #{sprint-no} Report
**Why**: The Sprint Report is part of your grade and helps you reflect on your past work. It also gives you the chance to step back, recognize your impact, and track your growth as a teammate and professional.  Each section is designed to help you think about your role, your progress, and how you are applying professional skills in a real project setting.

**What**: For Sprint #{sprint-no}, your report has three parts:

- **Self-Evaluation** - evaluate your presence, contributions, and collaboration using the provided rubrics, and justify your choices.
- **Implementation Check from Professional Development**
- **Reflection** - connect your experiences from this sprint to project practices and the program.

**When:** Sprint Report #{sprint-no} Due on Gradescope by {report-due}. Late work will not be accepted. 

*Where:* Submit the report on link:https://www.gradescope.com/[Gradescope] titled "Sprint 5: Report".
