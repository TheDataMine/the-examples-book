	<div>
		<p><b>What: </b>Read this article about <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation">The Importance of Documentation</a> and write a reflection in "Sprint 4: Professional Development".</p><br>
	</div>

  <div>
		<p><b>Why: </b>Documentation is essential in both The Data Mine and the real world. While it might not be the most exciting part of your job, it is one of the most valuable. Therefore, it is important to stay up to date with it and reflect on how your team has kept up thus far. </p><br>

<button class="accordion">Implicit Biases - Countermeasures</button>
<div class="panel">
	<div>
		<p><b>When: </b>Due Wednesday, September 4, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET. Late work will not be accepted.</p><br>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>What: </b>Watch the following video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIOGenWu_iA&list=PLWG_vsmMJ2clEeGKVyrOIKlOYrjFnVKqa&index=7 " >Implicit Bias: Lesson #6 - Countermeasures </a> (5 minutes). </p><br>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Where: </b>Complete the reflection for this professional development training on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> in the assignment "Sprint 5: Professional Development".</p><br>
  </div>
    <p><b>Why: </b> The video discusses strategies to mitigate implicit bias, emphasizing mindset, debiasing, and decoupling. Mindset involves being humble and mindful of our biases. Debiasing focuses on reshaping biases through exposure to counter-stereotypical examples. Decoupling aims to implement structures and procedures that minimize bias in decision-making. These strategies are crucial for recognizing and addressing implicit biases, which are pervasive and impact behavior. Understanding and applying these methods is essential for promoting fairness and equity in various settings. </p><br>

<button class="accordion">Implicit Biases - Implicit Association Test</button>
<div class="panel">
	<div>
		<p><b>When: </b>Due Wednesday, September 4, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET. Late work will not be accepted.</p><br>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>What: </b>Watch the following video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr9xAcWv790&list=PLWG_vsmMJ2clEeGKVyrOIKlOYrjFnVKqa&index=6 " >Implicit Bias: Lesson #5 - Implicit Association Test </a> (5 minutes).

		<p><b>Where: </b>Complete the reflection for this professional development training on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> in the assignment "Sprint 4: Professional Development".</p><br>
  </div>
    <p><b>Why: </b> The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a widely-used tool for measuring implicit biases by assessing reaction times in sorting tasks. It reveals how quickly we associate concepts like race or gender with positive or negative attributes. The IAT demonstrates that implicit biases are pervasive and statistically significant, even though the effect sizes are small. Despite its effectiveness, the IAT has limitations, such as the potential for variability in individual responses. Understanding these biases is crucial for addressing their impact on behavior and promoting equity. </p><br>
