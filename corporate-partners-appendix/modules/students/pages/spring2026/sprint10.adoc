    </div>
      <p><b>Why: </b> Biases, whether explicit or implicit, significantly impact our behaviors and decisions. Explicit biases are consciously accessible and can be self-reported, though people may be unwilling to share them due to social pressures. Implicit biases, on the other hand, are unconscious and cannot be identified through introspection. Understanding both explicit and implicit biases is crucial for promoting fairness and equity, especially in professional and academic settings, where these biases can subtly yet powerfully influence outcomes. </p><br>
