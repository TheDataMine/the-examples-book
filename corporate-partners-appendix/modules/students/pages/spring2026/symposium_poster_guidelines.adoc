** One student can write the script for the 3-minute thesis video. Make sure to practice reading it to ensure it fits within the required time. 
** One student can create the recording and voice over 
** One student can do any necessary editing and add the closed captions.

== Create your poster

* Create your poster outline in PowerPoint and save it in the general channel of your MS Teams group. 
** xref:attachment$Symposium_Poster_Template.pptx[Click here to download a basic poster template] or link:https://marcom.purdue.edu/toolbox/templates/all-templates/?search=poster&media=ms-office[explore additional Purdue poster templates]. We encourage you to change the colors of your poster to match the branding requirements of your corporate partner.
* Your TA will submit your poster draft and final version (one per team).
* *Your poster should not be text heavy* -- it is not a paper, so complete sentences should be limited. Make sure to include multiple visuals and keep sentences to a minimum. Bullet points are encouraged.
    * Consider setting a word limit (like 27 words per teammate) to help keep the amount of text low. Need more words? Work with a teammate to make use of their "unused" words.
* Make sure to include all of these categories:

[cols="3,5"]
|===

|*Introduction/Background/Motivation* |• We recommend looking back at the project description and materials shared during the first weeks of the fall semester. This will be a great resource to find introduction and background material and wording.
|*Research Methodology* |• The “how” of your research
|*Conclusions* |• What are your big picture findings? 
|*Future Goals* | • What are next steps if you had more time to continue? 
|*References & Acknowledgements* | • Thank your CRP Mentors, any faculty mentors, and others that helped on the project.

• Cite your sources! There may be too many to include, but list a few
*key* sources. 
|*Figures* | • Make sure to include relevant visuals
|*Layout & Design* | • Keep font and colors consistent.

• Make sure it is visually appealing. Zoom out and make the entire poster shows on your screen. What do you notice about it? Is it full of text? Too much white space? Not enough images? Flow is confusing?
