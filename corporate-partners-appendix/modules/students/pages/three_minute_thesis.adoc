= 3 Minute Thesis Professional Development Assignment

In preparation for the Spring 2024 Data Mine Symposium, The Data Mine wants students to practice 3 minute thesis to explain their research in a clear and concise manner. This assignment will help students develop their research communication skills and support the development of research students’ capacity to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience.

== 3 Minute Thesis

Imagine you have just 180 seconds to explain your complex research and project work
your team as completed since the beginning of term… but you can only use one slide
and leave out any technical jargon. That's the whole idea of the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT)

** The video doesn’t have to include everything you learned from the research paper, but it should discuss the motivation for the research topic, any necessary background (keep it brief), and the results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
