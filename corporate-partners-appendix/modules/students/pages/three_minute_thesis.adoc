= 3 Minute Thesis Professional Development Assignment

In preparation for the Spring 2024 Data Mine Symposium, The Data Mine wants students to practice 3-minute thesis to explain their research in a clear and concise manner. This assignment will help students develop their research communication skills and enhance their abilities to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience.

== 3 Minute Thesis

Imagine you have just 180 seconds to explain the complex research and project work
your team has completed since the beginning of term… but you can only use one slide
and leave out any technical jargon. That's the whole idea of the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT)

** The video doesn’t have to include everything you learned from the research paper. Still, it should discuss the motivation for the research topic, any necessary background (keep it brief), and the results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
