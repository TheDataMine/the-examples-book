== Sprint Dates
_All sprints will have the same due dates_, but the sprint start and end dates are slightly shifted depending on when a team has their lab (1 hour and 50 minutes) and team meeting (50 minutes). This is so that sprints always start with a lec and follow the format lec-lab-lec-lab.

You can find a xref:projectmanagement:ceremonies.adoc#sprint-schedule[visual of the sprint schedule in the Agile Training Ceremonies page]. More details will be covered in the agile training below.

== Sprint Tasks

NOTE: The first sprint has a lot of tasks to help aide with onboarding. To account for this extra time, more of your first sprint grade is allocated towards professional development. In future sprints, plan to spend more time working on your project.

=== &#10003; Project Management Training 

The Data Mine Corporate Partners will implement Agile methods into our project management. Agile is very popular in industry and the majority of our Corporate Partners use it. Now is the best time to practice it while you are a student. 

During your first or second lab session, you will be using Legos to learn the Agile approach to project management. Your TA will be facilitating this Lego lab. We encourage you to review this link:https://thisiszone.medium.com/using-lego-to-show-the-advantages-of-an-agile-approach-to-software-development-3eda6e5c2114[article].

=== &#10003; Professional Development 

The Data Mine Corporate Partners program is a professional development program. We want to help you develop the skills you need to be successful in your career. We will have a variety of professional development activities throughout the semester.

Each sprint you will complete a few professional development related tasks. To begin, let's review confidentiality, virtual meeting expectations, email communications and the Kanban Board. _Open each accordion by clicking on it, the combined sum pertain to one assignment in Gradescope._
