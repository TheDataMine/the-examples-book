= Final Presentation - Fall 2024

[IMPORTANT]
====
Final presentations must be kept **CONFIDENTIAL** to team/company! The presentations cannot be publicly shared.  
====

Your final presentation will be completed as a group during your last regularly scheduled 50-minute team meeting the week of December 2 - December 6, 2024.

A draft of your presentation is due on Wednesday, November 13, 2024. 

This final presentation is worth 15% of your grade and will help you prepare for The Data Mine Corporate Partner Symposium in April 2025.

The presentation will be ~35 minutes long with 15-20 minutes for discussion.

== Guidelines 

The Data Mine Corporate Partners Final Presentations will showcase the hard work of students this semester and their goals for spring 2024. It will help everybody get on the same page and make sure all team members have a thorough understanding of the work. Knowing how to *do* something and knowing how to *explain* something are two different skills, and it is important to be skilled at both.
 
**Research for fall 2024 should NOT stop at this draft. Continue working on your research and you may continue to update the slides up until the day of your presentation **

=== When
The final presentation will occur during your last 50-minute team meeting of the semester, during the week of Monday, December 2 – Friday, December 6, 2024. 

=== Expectations 

•	**Each student must contribute to the presentation in some capacity. **  
•	Not every student needs to speak during the presentation, but if you don’t speak during the presentation, consider answering a question during Q&A. 
•	For example, here are some suggested roles students can fill (not required to be broken up this way):
    - Student 1: introduction
    - Student 2: summary
    - Student 3: formatting 
    - Student 4: script/notes for the presentation
    - Students 5-10: talk and give the presentation
    - Students 11-14: answer questions after the presentation 

=== Design

•	The presentation should look professional. You are encouraged to use a branded template from your Corporate Partner or a Purdue template. A Purdue template is available for xref:attachment$Purdue-branded-powerpoint-template-reduced.pptx[download here].

=== Content 
*Introduction/Background/Motivation (~10%)*

- Include a slide with team profile (picture with name and major of each student)
- Introduce the project and provide a brief background (there will be colleagues at the presentation that will likely not be familiar with your project)

*Fall 2024 work (~45%)* 

- Summarize your work this semester. Do not go too deep into the nitty gritty details (you should not have screenshots or pasted code in your presentation). 
- Feel free to include a demo (outside of a PowerPoint) if this is relevant to your team.

*Spring 2025 goals (~40%)* 

- Include your plan for spring 2025. Be strategic and discuss what you plan to accomplish by when and how you define a “success”. 

*Summary (~5%)* 

- Include a slide of references and acknowledgements. Thank your mentors and any faculty members.
- Summarize your presentation briefly and open the floor to discussion and questions

== Preparation 

To create an outline for your presentation, we will be using ideas from Professional Development #5.

*Transformation matrix:* The transformation matrix will help your team understand what your objectives for this presentation are and then create an outline for your presentation based on that. 

Students will fill out the contents of the matrix in Professional Development #5. Then, in Teams will fill it out together in lab during Sprint #5. Please watch this video for more information link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU&t=189s[Transformation Matrix]

Please use this table when completing this exercise in lab.

1. You will begin by filling out what your audience knows, believes (what they think), feels (an emotion) and does about the contents of your presentation. 

2. Then, you will fill out the "After" column, but in the reverse order. What you want your audience to do, feel, believe and know after your presentation?

3. Lastly, you want to fill in the center column - the Transformation Column. This column will be what you can *say, do* or *show* in your presentation to get the audience members to where you want them to be. In lab, you can use sticky notes or bullet points to fill out the center column. Each box can have multiple ideas that help transform the audience to where you want them after.

The ideas in the transformation column will make up the contents of your presentation. You can use them as an outline for your slides.

*Data Storytelling:* In addition to the outline provided by the transformation matrix, we want to create presentations that tell a story. This will make your presentations more engaging for your audience. 

In Professional Development #5, students filled out what their projects set up, conflict and resolution is. TA's please watch this short video for more information link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_34YnCmMY[Data Syorytelling]. 

After creating the transformation matrix, as a team talk through how you will tell a story with your data. Try to integrate these concepts into your outline provided by the transformation matrix. Answer the following questions together in lab. 

1. What is the setup of your projects story? What is the before state of the data? 

2. What is the conflict within your projects story? How is your data changing? Why?

3. What is the resolution within your project? What is the after state the change has lead to?


*Other Tips*
Additional tips on written and verbal communication on the tips page xref:fall2022/final_presentation_tips.adoc[Final Presentation Tips]

- The percentages in parenthesis are approximations of how much you should spend talking about each section. It is important to be strategically planning for your spring 2025 goals which is why ~40% of the presentation should be prospective. 
- Make sure to make your slides interesting – include pictures/figures/screenshots. 
- Limit text when possible. 
- Be aware of your audience. Ask your Corporate Partner Mentor who will be coming to the presentation. Some may have technical experience whereas others have business domain experience.  
- The presentation does not have to hide company protected material because these presentations will only be given to internal colleagues to the companies. These presentations will *not* be shared publicly like the posters in the spring semester. 
- Plan out who will be speaking for each section, how much time each team member will have to speak, and how to transition between speakers smoothly. 
- Practice! Practice! Practice! This is your final presentation of the semester. Make sure to practice and prepare. 

=== Length 

•	The team meeting is 50 minutes. 
•	Your presentation should be 30-40 minutes with 10-15 minutes for questions and discussion. 
    - You should prepare a few questions to get the Q&A started if no guests have questions right away. Practice answering questions that you think may come up. Take turns answering them too. 
•	Make sure to leave time for a demonstration *if* you are including one. This does not apply to all groups. 

== Grading 

The final presentation is worth 15% of your fall 2024 grade (per the syllabus). The final presentation and deliverable grades will be determined in collaboration with The Data Mine staff and Corporate Partner Mentors.

== Draft 

A draft of your presentation is due *Wednesday, November 13, 2024*. The reason your draft is due this early is to allow The Data Mine staff and Corporate Partners Mentors to review the material and provide feedback. 

Each TA will submit the draft link on behalf of the team. The presentation should be created and shared in PowerPoint online. 

Your draft should include all slides that you plan to include. 60%+ of slides should be complete, but some may be “placeholders” and have outlines or notes if you are still working on your fall 2024 research.

**Research for fall 2024 should *NOT* stop at this draft. Continue working on your research and you may continue to update the slides up until the day of your presentation **
