== Sprint Tasks

=== &#10003; Professional Development 

The Data Mine Corporate Partners program is a professional development program. We want to help you develop the skills you need to be successful in your career. We will have a variety of professional development activities throughout the semester.  

Each sprint you will complete a few professional development-related tasks. In this sprint, we will begin to prepare you for Final Presentations at the end of the semester via Data Storytelling and a framework for How to give a Strong Presentation. Additionally, we will be checking in on your teams progress with the Kanban Board.

		<p><b>Why: </b> Data storytelling allows you to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights that are meaningful to major stakeholders on your project. By weaving data into a narrative, you can engage your audience, highlight key points, and make complex information more accessible. This approach helps you effectively communicate your findings, persuade stakeholders, and drive informed decision-making.</p><br>
