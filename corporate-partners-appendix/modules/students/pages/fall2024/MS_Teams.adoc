= Microsoft Teams

The Data Mine uses Microsoft Team for team communication and collaboration. The Microsoft suite of applications is *free* for all students. The Data Mine will use MS Teams as mode of chatting as well as video calls for online meetings with mentors. 

== Download

You can download Microsoft Teams for your phone or desktop at this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app[link].

Breakout Rooms are a new feature to Purdue's instance of Microsoft Teams, it can be initiated by selecting the 'Rooms' icon by 'Apps' in the meeting bar. You will be unable to assign co-organizers to a room as they are able to move freely, consider using the primary room for discussion between organizers.

TAs should email datamine-help@purdue.edu to request to be added as a co-organizer for breakout room privileges.
