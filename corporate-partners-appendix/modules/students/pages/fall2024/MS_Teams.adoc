= Microsoft Teams 

The Data Mine uses Microsoft Team for team communication and collaboration. The Microsoft suite of applications is *free* for all students. The Data Mine will use MS Teams as mode of chatting as well as video calls for online meetings with mentors.

== Finding your meeting link

When you register for a Corporate Partners Project, you will automatically be added to a MS Teams channel for that project. It may take about a day to register on the back end so please be patient. If you do not get added after 36 hours, please submit a ticket to datamine-help@purdue.edu.

The call information for your virtual 50-minute (LEC) team meeting (and online lab if applicable for NDMN) are pinned in the MS Teams chat. You can access the pinned message by clicking on the "i" for information in the top right of the _General_ channel.

== Breakout Rooms

Breakout Rooms are a new feature to Purdue's instance of Microsoft Teams, it can be initiated by selecting the 'Rooms' icon by 'Apps' in the meeting bar. You will be unable to assign co-organizers to a room as they are able to move freely, consider using the primary room for discussion between organizers.

TAs should email datamine-help@purdue.edu to request to be added as a co-organizer for breakout room privileges.
