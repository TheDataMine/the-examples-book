[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Your feedback is one of the most important ways you can help shape this program. The Professional Development assignments you completed this semester were designed to strengthen soft skills such as teamwork, communication, conflict resolution, and Agile practices among others.  These skills are just as important as technical knowledge when working with Corporate Partners and in your future career. Last year's feedback led to major improvements, and your input this semester will help make these assignments even more valuable for future students.

*What:* Reflect on the Professional Development assignments you completed this semester. Share what was most useful, what could be improved, and any gaps you think we should address in the future. Your perspective ensures these assignments continue to evolve in ways that support you and those who come after you.

.*3. Professional Development Adventure*

*Why:* We wanted to give you the opportunity to explore a professional development topic of your choice that interests you. This could be related to leadership, communication, time management, or any other soft skill you believe would benefit your personal and professional growth.

*What:* Identify a topic that interests you and find two resources (article, video, podcast, etc.) that provides valuable insights on that topic. Write a reflection summarizing what you learned from these resources and how you plan to apply this knowledge in your future endeavors.
