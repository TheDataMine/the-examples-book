[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* A high-quality final presentation is essential for your project's success in The Data Mine. The concepts in this video will help you build an outline for your team's presentation. We aim for these presentations to be professional, not only to impress our mentors but also to teach you how to create successful presentations in the real world.

*What:* Watch this Ted Talk about link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU[How to Give a Strong Presentation] (15 minutes) and complete the assignment in Gradescope. Make sure you watch until the end, as most of your assignment will be based on the Transformation Matrix.

.**2. Data Storytelling**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Data storytelling allows you to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights that are meaningful to major stakeholders on your project. By weaving data into a narrative, you can engage your audience, highlight key points, and make complex information more accessible. This approach helps you effectively communicate your findings, persuade stakeholders, and drive informed decision-making.

*What:* Watch the following video on link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_34YnCmMY[Storytelling with Data] (5 minutes) and complete the reflection questions in Gradescope.
====

.**3. Addressing Different Audiences**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Your team will likely have a variety of people at your final presentations. Each will have a different amount of background knowledge about the project and will have different expectations for what they expect to get out of this project. It is important to recognize these differences and address them the best you can while presenting. 

*What:* Read this article about link:https://www.quanthub.com/how-to-identify-your-audience-for-impactful-data-storytelling/[How to Address Different Audiences] and complete the reflection in Gradescope.

=== &#10003;Sprint #4 Report
**Why**: The Sprint Report is part of your grade and helps you reflect on your past work. It also gives you the chance to step back, recognize your impact, and track your growth as a teammate and professional.  Each section is designed to help you think about your role, your progress, and how you are applying professional skills in a real project setting.


**What**: For Sprint #4, your report has three parts:

- **Self-Evaluation** – evaluate your presence, contributions, and collaboration using the provided rubrics, and justify your choices.
 - **Implementation Check from Professional Development** 
- **Reflection** 

**Sprint Report #4 Due**: on Gradescope by Wednesday, October 29, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET. Late work will not be accepted.
