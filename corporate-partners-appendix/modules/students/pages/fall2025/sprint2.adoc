[%collapsible%open]

Understanding the difference between business professional and business casual ensures you dress appropriately for various professional settings, including career fairs, interviews, networking events, and even The Symposium. Dressing correctly demonstrates respect for the occasion and shows that you understand and can adhere to workplace norms, which helps make a positive impression on your reputation and image.

====

[[team-contract]]
=== &#10003; Team Contract
*Why:* Creating a team contract is important because it establishes clear expectations, roles, and responsibilities for all team members from the beginning. This document promotes accountability, enhances communication, and minimizes misunderstandings by outlining agreed-upon norms and procedures. It serves as a reference point throughout the project, helping to resolve conflicts and ensuring everyone is aligned with the team's goals.

*What:* In lab, you will (or may already have) discuss the topics included in the Team Contract outline. These discussions help establish norms and set clear expectations for your team early on—so you can avoid common issues like miscommunication, uneven workloads, or missed deadlines later. Before lab, take a few minutes to review the Team Contract Outline and begin thinking about what should be included for your project. As you prepare, also reflect on why the contract matters and how it can support your team’s success.
