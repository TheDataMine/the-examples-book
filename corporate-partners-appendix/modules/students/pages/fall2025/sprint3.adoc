[[professional-development]]
=== &#10003; Professional Development

During this sprint, we will complete Mock Interviews to help you prepare and gain confidence for upcoming interviews.

.**Practice Mock Interview**
[%collapsible%open]
====

*Why:* Interviews are a critical step in securing internships and jobs. Mock interviews give you a low-stakes space to practice, get feedback, and build confidence. At first they can feel a bit challenging, but over time they get easier and more natural. You also get to experience different types of questions that might come up, which helps you be more prepared when it really counts. All of this will set you up to perform strongly, increasing your chances of landing the internship or job you want.

*What:* Review the **Interview Preparation** instructions using the link for your group: link:https://the-examples-book.com/crp/students/interview_prep.#purdue-students[Purdue Students] or link:https://the-examples-book.com/crp/students/interview_prep.#ndmn-indiana-data-mine-students[NDMN & Indiana Data Mine Students]. Then complete the two-part assignment in Gradescope *"Sprint 3: Professional Development"* by:  

- Completing a full mock interview and submitting a screenshot of your completed practice sessions  
- Reflecting on your performance by identifying strengths and areas for improvement

.**Learn Conflict Resolution**
[%collapsible%open]
====
*Why:* Conflicts are a natural part of teamwork, especially in project settings. How we handle them can either strengthen or weaken the team. Applying constructive approaches, supported by your team norms, helps you build trust, collaborate effectively, and grow key professional skills like communication and leadership.

*What:*  Please read this article link:https://www.wellable.co/blog/conflict-resolution-techniques-in-the-workplace/[Effective Conflict Resolution Techniques In The Workplace]. and learn about: +
**3 Pronciples**, **5 Skills**, and **7 Steps**. Then complete the assignment in Gradescope "Sprint 3: Professional Development" by doing the following:

 - Reflect on which skill you find most challenging (skills reflection)
 - Apply all 7 steps to a conflict from your experience or one of the given example scenarios

*Note*: As a team, pick one conflict resolution step or skill from the article and apply it during Sprint 4 in your project. Be ready to share which one you chose and how it worked.

====

.**The Role of Documentation**
[%collapsible%open]
====

*Why:* Documentation is essential in both The Data Mine and the real world. It might not feel exciting, but it is one of the most valuable habits you can build. Clear documentation shows that you can communicate your work effectively — a skill employers value highly and one that will give you an advantage in your career.

*What:* Read the articles link:https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation[The Importance of Documentation], link:https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/process-documentation[Process Documentation], and link:https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/product-documentation[Product Documentation]. After reading, respond to the reflection questions for each in Gradespace.

'''
[[documentation]]
=== &#10003; Documentation in your project

**Why:** The purpose of discussing documentation in your project is to clarify how mentors expect information about your work to be recorded and shared. It also helps you strengthen your skills by reviewing the project charter, preparing thoughtful questions, and building a common understanding of how documentation should support your team and stakeholders. 

**What:** 

- In lab, your TA will facilitate a team activity focused on reviewing the project charter and identifying documentation expectations. The goal is to build a shared understanding of the documentation framework so your team is prepared for the mentor meeting. 

- During mentor meetings, your TA will guide the team in sharing how they understood the documentation requirements. You are encouraged to take an active role by asking questions, clarifying expectations, and engaging in the discussion to strengthen your understanding of documentation.

[[sprint3-report]]
=== &#10003; Sprint #3 Report
**Why**: The Sprint Report is part of your grade and helps you reflect on your past work. It also gives you the chance to step back, recognize your impact, and track your growth as a teammate and professional. In this Sprint Report, in addition to the regular questions, you will have the opportunity to share the aspect of your project work you are most proud of. This input will supplement the mid-semester feedback provided by mentors and TAs. Each section is designed to help you think about your role, your progress, and how you are applying professional skills in a real project setting.

**What**: For Sprint #3, your report has three parts:

 - **Self-Evaluation** – evaluate your presence, contributions, and collaboration using the provided rubrics, and justify your choices.
- **Showcase Work You’re Proud Of** _(Mid-Semester Feedback)_ – Highlight the aspect of your work so far that you are most proud of.
 - **Implementation Check from Professional Development (Team Norms)** 

**Sprint Report #3 Due**: on Gradescope by Wednesday, October 15, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET. Late work will not be accepted.
