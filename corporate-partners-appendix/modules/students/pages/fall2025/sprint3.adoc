[%collapsible%open]
====

*Why:* Interviews are a critical step in securing internships and jobs. Mock interviews give you a low-stakes space to practice, get feedback, and build confidence. At first they can feel a bit challenging, but over time they get easier and more natural. You also get to experience different types of questions that might come up, which helps you be more prepared when it really counts. All of this will set you up to perform strongly, increasing your chances of landing the internship or job you want.

*What:* Review the **Interview Preparation** instructions using the link for your group: link:https://the-examples-book.com/crp/students/interview_prep.#purdue-students[Purdue Students] or link:https://the-examples-book.com/crp/students/interview_prep.#ndmn-indiana-data-mine-students[NDMN & Indiana Data Mine Students]. Then complete the two-part assignment in Gradescope *"Sprint 3: Professional Development"* by:  

- Completing a full mock interview and submitting a screenshot of your completed practice sessions  
- Reflecting on your performance by identifying strengths and areas for improvement

*Why:* Conflicts are a natural part of teamwork, especially in projects or diverse groups. How conflicts are managed often determines whether a team grows stronger or breaks down. Learning constructive approaches to conflict resolution helps you build trust, strengthen collaboration, and develop leadership skills. These are professional abilities valued in any workplace setting — being able to listen actively, address disagreements respectfully, and work toward solutions that keep the team moving forward.

====

*Why:* Documentation is essential in both The Data Mine and the real world. It might not feel exciting, but it is one of the most valuable habits you can build. Clear documentation shows that you can communicate your work effectively — a skill employers value highly and one that will give you an advantage in your career.

*What:* Read the articles link:https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation[The Importance of Documentation], link:https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/process-documentation[Process Documentation], and link:https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/product-documentation[Product Documentation].

[[documentation]]
=== &#10003; Documentation in your project

**Why:** The purpose of facilitating documentation discussion in your project is to understand how your mentors would like information about your work to be recorded and shared. This is also an opportunity to build your skills in gathering requirements by asking questions and creating clear expectations for how documentation should support your team and stakeholders.  

**What:** 

- In mentor meetings, your TA will facilitate the discussion (or may already have), and you should take a proactive role in gaining knowledge about documentation by asking questions and clarifying requirements. 
- In lab, your team will use these insights to create a sample documentation requirements format that defines what should be included, where it should be stored, and how often it should be updated. Once this format is established, your team will begin applying it consistently so that documentation becomes a reliable part of your project workflow.

[[sprint3-report]]
=== &#10003; Sprint #3 Report
**Why**: The Sprint Report is part of your grade and helps you reflect on your past work. It also gives you the chance to step back, recognize your impact, and track your growth as a teammate and professional. This Sprint Report additionally contains instead 2 , 3 collabiration tasks completed so far as your responses will be used to supplement the mid-semester feedback given by mentors and TAs. Each section is designed to help you think about your role, your progress, and how you are applying professional skills in real project settings.

**What**: For Sprint #3, your report has two parts:

 - **Self-Evaluation** – evaluate your presence, contributions, and collaboration using the provided rubrics, and justify your choices.
 - **Implementation Check from Professional Development** 

**Sprint Report #3 Due**: on Gradescope by Wednesday, October 15, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET. Late work will not be accepted.
