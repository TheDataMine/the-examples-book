== Overview

This presentation is designed to strengthen both your **technical communication** and **team storytelling skills**.  
Knowing how to do something and knowing how to explain it clearly are two different abilities — both are essential for success in professional and research settings.  

Starting from sprint #5, you will develop and refine your presentation in three stages.

- *Draft* (due Nov 19)
- *Final* (due Dec 5)
- *Delivery* (Dec 8 - 12)


Each stage builds on the previous one, allowing your team to progressively improve the content, structure, and clarity of your work.  


The presentation gives you the opportunity to **showcase your team’s progress, learning, and collaboration** this semester while preparing for *The Data Mine Corporate Partner Symposium* in April.  
It serves two key purposes:  

1. To summarize your **fall accomplishments** and the foundation you’ve built.  
2. To set clear, strategic **goals for spring 2026** as you continue your project.  

---

== Presentation Stages

The presentation process is divided into three key stages.  
Each stage includes its own deliverable, focus, and purpose to help your team plan effectively.

NOTE: The draft (due Nov 19) should be at least 80% complete with placeholders for any remaining work, visuals, or slides.

== Guidelines

=== Roles & Responsibilities

* **Each student must contribute to the presentation in some capacity.**  
  Contributions may include speaking, designing slides, organizing content, coordinating transitions, or managing Q&A.

* Not every student is required to speak, but those who are not presenting are *still expected to attend the presentation* and should be prepared to answer questions and support discussion.

* The distribution of roles will vary by team size and structure. Below are **examples of possible roles** (not required to be divided exactly this way):

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Students** | **Responsibilities**

| Student 1 | Introduction
| Student 2 | Summary
| Student 3 | Formatting and visual design
| Student 4 | Script or speaker notes
| Students 5–10 | Present sections of the project
| Students 11–14 | Lead Q&A or demo discussions
|===

---

=== Design

A clear and consistent visual design helps your audience stay focused on your message.  
Follow these guidelines to make your presentation professional and easy to follow:

* Keep your slides **professional and cohesive**.
* Use **consistent fonts, colors, and layouts** across all slides to create a unified look.
* Whenever possible, use a **branded template** from your Corporate Partner or the **Purdue template** (xref:attachment$Purdue-branded-powerpoint-template-reduced.pptx[Download the Purdue template here].).
* Ensure all **visuals are high quality** and that **text is easy to read** when projected or shared on screen.

---

=== Content Overview
Your presentation should tell a clear, engaging story about your team’s journey this semester and your plans for the next.  
It should highlight *what you achieved*, *what you learned*, and *where you are heading next*.  
Aim for a balance between technical detail and general understanding — so that everyone, from technical mentors to business leaders, can follow along.  
Keep slides concise, visual, and focused on your key insights, outcomes, and goals.  

Below is a general guideline showing how much time and focus to allocate for each section of your presentation. These percentages reflect the *approximate value* of each section and how they contribute to your overall story.

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
| **Section** | **Guidelines**

| *Introduction / Background / Motivation (~10%)* 
| - Include a slide with your team profile (picture with name and major of each student).  +
- Introduce the project and provide a brief background — remember that not everyone attending will be familiar with your project.  +
- Explain why the project matters and what problem it aims to solve.

| *Fall 2025 Research (~45%)*
| - Summarize your main accomplishments this semester without going too deep into technical details (avoid screenshots or pasted code).  +
- Focus on outcomes, results, and lessons learned.  +
- Include a demo (outside of PowerPoint) if this is relevant to your team.

| *Spring 2026 Planning (~40%)*
| - Outline your plan for spring 2026.  +
- Be strategic — explain what you plan to accomplish, when, and how you define “success.”  +
- Connect your goals to your fall progress to show continuity.

| *Summary (~5%)* 
| - Include a slide of references and acknowledgements. Thank your mentors and any faculty members.  +
- Summarize your presentation briefly and open the floor to discussion and questions.  +
- End with a clear takeaway that captures your team’s main impact or next big step.
|===

TIP: Use this breakdown to guide your timing — roughly 3–4 minutes for the introduction, 15–18 minutes for fall work, 12–15 minutes for spring goals, and 2–3 minutes for the summary and Q&A transition.

---

=== Preparation

Preparing your final presentation involves both **individual reflection** and **team collaboration**.  
You will use concepts from *Professional Development #5* to plan, structure, and communicate your project effectively.

Your team will use the **Transformation Matrix** to create an outline for your presentation.  
Each student will first complete this matrix individually in Gradescope for *Professional Development Assignment #5*.  
Then, during lab, your team will combine individual inputs to build one shared outline for your final presentation.

In addition, you will apply **Data Storytelling** principles to explain your project clearly and persuasively.  
This means focusing on flow, clarity, and purpose — telling the story of what your team achieved, what challenges you faced, and where you are headed next.  
You will practice this skill both individually (through PD #5) and collectively as a team in lab.  
Be sure to integrate storytelling concepts directly into your outline.


*Additional Tips*

For more detailed communication strategies, see the xref:fall2022/final_presentation_tips.adoc[Final Presentation Tips] page.  
Below are key reminders as you prepare your presentation:

[cols="25,75", options="header"]
|===
| Section | Guidance

| **Content Allocation** | The percentages in parentheses *(10%, 45%, 40%, 5%)* indicate the approximate amount of time to spend on each section.  
Focus strategically on your **Spring 2026 goals**, which should make up about **40%** of your presentation.

| **Visual Design** | Make your slides **visually engaging** — include relevant figures, images, and screenshots.  
Limit text when possible. Use **concise bullet points** and let visuals support your message.

| **Audience Awareness** | **Know your audience.** Ask your Corporate Partner Mentor who will be attending.  
Some guests may have **technical expertise**, while others may come from **business or management** backgrounds.

| **Confidentiality** | You do **not need to hide company-protected information** — these presentations are for **internal audiences only** and will not be shared publicly like the spring posters.

| **Team Preparation** | **Plan ahead:** decide who will speak for each section, estimate speaking time, and plan transitions between presenters.

| **Practice & Delivery** | **Practice often.** Rehearse as a team to ensure flow, timing, and comfort with delivery.  
This is your **final major presentation** of the semester — **preparation matters!**
|===

---

=== Length

- The team meeting is 50 minutes.  
- Your presentation should last **30–40 minutes**, followed by **10–15 minutes** for questions and discussion.  
- Prepare a few **starter questions** in case the audience does not have immediate questions.  
- **Practice answering** potential questions together — take turns responding so all team members can contribute.  
- If you are including a demonstration, be sure to **allocate time** for it. (Not all teams are required to demo.)

---

== *Rubric* 

Your presentation will be evaluated based on both **content quality** and **delivery**.  +
The rubric is designed to recognize thorough preparation, professional communication, and collaboration within your team.  +
Each category reflects skills that are important not only for this project but also for communicating complex ideas effectively in a professional setting.

////
Your final presentation will be completed as a group during your last regularly scheduled 50-minute team meeting the week of December 8 - December 12, 2025.

A draft of your presentation is due on Wednesday, November 19, 2025.

This final presentation is worth 10% of your grade and will help you prepare for The Data Mine Corporate Partner Symposium in April 2026.

The presentation will be ~35 minutes long with 10-15 minutes for questions/discussion.

== *Guidelines* 

The Data Mine Corporate Partners Final Presentations will showcase the hard work of students this semester and their goals for spring 2026. It will help everybody get on the same page and make sure all team members have a thorough understanding of the work. Knowing how to *do* something and knowing how to *explain* something are two different skills, and it is important to be skilled at both.
 
**Research for fall should NOT stop at this draft. Continue working on your research and you may continue to update the slides up until the day of your presentation **

=== *When*
The final presentation will occur during your last 50-minute team meeting of the semester, during the week of Monday, December 8 - Friday, December 12, 2025.

=== *Expectations* 

* **Each student must contribute to the presentation in some capacity. **  
* Not every student needs to speak during the presentation, but if you don't speak during the presentation, consider answering a question during Q&A. 
* For example, here are some suggested roles students can fill (not required to be broken up this way):
    - Student 1: introduction
    - Student 2: summary
    - Student 3: formatting 
    - Student 4: script/notes for the presentation
    - Students 5-10: talk and give the presentation
    - Students 11-14: answer questions after the presentation 

=== *Design*

•	The presentation should look professional. You are encouraged to use a branded template from your Corporate Partner or a Purdue template. A Purdue template is available for xref:attachment$Purdue-branded-powerpoint-template-reduced.pptx[download here].

=== *Content* 
*Introduction/Background/Motivation (~10%)*

- Include a slide with team profile (picture with name and major of each student)
- Introduce the project and provide a brief background (there will be colleagues at the presentation that will likely not be familiar with your project)

*Fall 2025 work (~45%)* 

- Summarize your work this semester. Do not go too deep into the nitty gritty details (you should not have screenshots or pasted code in your presentation). 
- Feel free to include a demo (outside of a PowerPoint) if this is relevant to your team.

*Spring 2026 goals (~40%)* 

- Include your plan for spring 2026. Be strategic and discuss what you plan to accomplish by when and how you define a “success”. 

*Summary (~5%)* 

- Include a slide of references and acknowledgements. Thank your mentors and any faculty members.
- Summarize your presentation briefly and open the floor to discussion and questions

=== *Preparation* 

To create an outline for your presentation, we will be using ideas from Professional Development #5. 

Your team will use the Transformation Matrix to create an outline for your presentation. Individually, you will fill out this matrix in Gradescope for Professional Development Assignment #5. Then, as a team, you will fill this matrix in lab, to create your presentation outline.  

Additionally, your team will use concepts from Data Storytelling to explain your project. Similarly, you will complete this assignment individually in Professional Development Assignment #5 and then as a team in the following lab. It is important you integrate these concepts into your outline.    

*Other Tips*
Additional tips on written and verbal communication on the tips page xref:fall2022/final_presentation_tips.adoc[Final Presentation Tips]

- The percentages in parenthesis are approximations of how much you should spend talking about each section. It is important to be strategically planning for your spring 2026 goals which is why ~40% of the presentation should be prospective. 
- Make sure to make your slides interesting – include pictures/figures/screenshots. 
- Limit text when possible. 
- Be aware of your audience. Ask your Corporate Partner Mentor who will be coming to the presentation. Some may have technical experience whereas others have business domain experience.  
- The presentation does not have to hide company protected material because these presentations will only be given to internal colleagues to the companies. These presentations will *not* be shared publicly like the posters in the spring semester. 
- Plan out who will be speaking for each section, how much time each team member will have to speak, and how to transition between speakers smoothly. 
- Practice! Practice! Practice! This is your final presentation of the semester. Make sure to practice and prepare. 

=== *Length* 

- The team meeting is 50 minutes. 
- Your presentation should be 30-40 minutes with 10-15 minutes for questions and discussion. 
    - You should prepare a few questions to get the Q&A started if no guests have questions right away. Practice answering questions that you think may come up. Take turns answering them too. 
- Make sure to leave time for a demonstration *if* you are including one. This does not apply to all groups. 

== *Grading* 

The final presentation is worth 10% of your fall grade (per the syllabus). The final presentation and deliverable grades will be determined in collaboration with The Data Mine staff and Corporate Partner Mentors.
