		<p><b>Why: </b> Data storytelling allows you to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights that are meaningful to major stakeholders on your project. By weaving data into a narrative, you can engage your audience, highlight key points, and make complex information more accessible. This approach helps you effectively communicate your findings, persuade stakeholders, and drive informed decision-making.</p><br>

    <p><b>When: </b>Due Wednesday, October 23, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET. Late work will not be accepted.</p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>What: </b>Watch the following video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgqGAXvLB8&list=PLWG_vsmMJ2clEeGKVyrOIKlOYrjFnVKqa&index=3 ">Implicit Biases: Lesson #2 - Attitudes and Stereotypes</a> (4 minutes).</p>

    <br>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Why: </b>Our brains automatically categorize people into social groups, activating associated attitudes and stereotypes, often without our conscious awareness. These implicit biases are often invisible but can significantly influence our interactions and decisions. Understanding the impact of implicit biases is crucial, as they subtly yet powerfully shape our behaviors and judgments. It's essential to recognize these biases and implement strategies to mitigate their effects, promoting fairness and equity.</p>
