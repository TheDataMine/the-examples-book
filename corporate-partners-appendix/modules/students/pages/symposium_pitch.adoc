= Symposium Pitch


== Assignment overview

Imagine it is April 24, 2024 and you are presenting your project at The Data Mine Symposium. A visitor approaches your poster and asks you to tell them about your project. What do you say? Your goal is to explain your project in less than a minute and a half in a meaningful way that describes the background, impact, and what you learned as a part of this experience. 

Please structure your symposium pitch to include the following:

* Introduction
** Who are you? (Hi, I'm (name) majoring in...)
** Role on project (How did you contribute?)
* What is your project about? (We partnered with (company) and our project goal was...)
* Why is it important? (For a non-technical person, why would this project matter to them?)
* Who does it impact? (How will your project work be used or what key learnings did it generate for your corporate partner?)
* What have you learned? (Because of this work, I discovered...)

== Guidelines

* You are limited to 1 minute and 30 seconds.
** 1 minute minimum. 
* You must have your camera on when recording your pitch.
** You must be in the video
* Pitch must be in spoken word (e.g. no poems, raps, or songs)
