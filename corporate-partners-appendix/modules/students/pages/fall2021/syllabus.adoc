=== Data Scientists 

*If no Data Scientist is assigned to your team, you can email datamine@purdue.edu for support and your question will be directed to the team member who can best support your team.*

The data scientists employed by The Data Mine are here to help students with the technical topics and concepts that they will encounter during their projects. The data scientist team has a varied background in topics such as natural language processing (NLP), geospatial information systems (GIS), high performance computing, and machine learning.

Each data scientist is assigned to a specific corporate partner project. A reference table is included below. If you have a question for a member of the Data Science team, please contact the data scientist assigned to your project first. They will bring in other members of the team as needed. They are here to help so don’t be worried when asking questions!

When scheduling a meeting with a data scientist keep in mind that they are designed to be collaborative. The team wants to see any solutions that you’ve attempted and where you may be getting stuck. Also, for more complicated questions it helps to give some advance notice of the topics over email. We aren’t experts in all of data science and some research may be required. 

=== Corporate Partner Mentors
Your Corporate Partner Mentor(s) are employees of the company you are working with. You will meet once a week with them online (unless the company is in West Lafayette, IN or visiting Purdue for a meeting). Please treat all communication with them in a *professional* manner – they are like your supervisor during an internship. They also act as a product owner and can help to answer questions or find resources for any product specific questions that you have during the project.

=== Corporate Partner TAs
Our Corporate Partner TAs will serve as peer mentors and team leaders for each of our projects. Nearly all of our CRP TAs have been in The Data Mine Corporate Partners program in past years and many are returning to the same project. The CRP TAs will lead the weekly student meeting (lab – 2 hours) when you are not meeting with the Corporate Partner Mentor(s). They should also be the first person to go to when you have a technical question or questions about your project.

If no Data Scientist is assigned to your team, you can email datamine@purdue.edu for support and your question will be directed to the team member who can best support your team.

=== Grading Scale
The general guidelines The Data Mine uses for evaluating your work with Corporate Partners are the following:

•	A+ (100):  Did all the work on time and exceeded the company’s expectations. 
•	A (95):  Did all the work on time, communicated and collaborated well with the team and corporate mentor, and put significant effort into learning.
•	B (85):  Did most of the work, maybe was late a few times, maybe put in a little less effort or didn’t communicate/collaborate as well. 
•	C (75):  Missed some of the work or was frequently late and making excuses; likely lacking in communication or collaboration with the team.
•	D (65):  Put in very little effort to learn/contribute to the project with very little to no communication.
•	F (50):  Disappeared or did minimal work and didn’t collaborate.

The numbers in parenthesis next to the letter grades are the numerical values that will be entered in Brightspace for your Corporate Partners Mentor Evaluation grade. 

This course will follow the 90-80-70-60 grading scale for A, B, C, D cut-offs.  If you earn a 90.000 in the class, for example, that is a solid A.  +/- grades will be given at the instructor’s discretion below these cut-offs.  If you earn an 89.11 in the class, for example, this may be an A- or a B 

* A: 100.000% – 90.000%
* B: 89.999% – 80.000%
* C: 79.999% – 70.000%
* D: 69.999% – 60.000%
* F: 59.999% – 0.000%


 
=== Late Policy 
We do NOT accept late work, unless there are extenuating circumstances.  It is better to submit a partially done report than nothing at all. Partial credit can be earned for work turned in on time. The electronic submission systems also do not allow for late work. We cannot make exceptions for these items once the submission deadline has passed. 

=== Course Site
All course material will be posted in the link:https://the-examples-book.com/crp/introduction[Corporate Partners section of The Examples Book]. 

All assignments will be submitted through link:https://purdue.brightspace.com/[Brightspace] or link:https://www.gradescope.com/[Gradescope] 

== Course Description
Students in The Data Mine Corporate Partners Learning Community will work in groups with Corporate Partner Mentors on a variety of projects.  They will analyze real data related to questions that the Corporate Partner proposes.  Most projects will last for a full academic year (late August through late April), with multiple reports and presentations given more frequently.  The mentor is expected to meet with the students weekly by Microsoft Teams, or (more rarely) in person. Students are expected to actively participate in these meetings and in all individual and group work.  The goal of the course is to help students build impactful industry related skills in data science, visualization, and data engineering. The Data Mine staff also has data scientists who can assist students with technical questions focused on the skills being built and the research conducted. Students can work on real-world industry facing issues that have a high value add for the corporate partner. 

=== Sponsored Student Class Project Notice 

This course permits you, the student to participate in a class project that has been sponsored by a third party other than the University. The University encourages and supports your participation in this practical learning experience. Although your course requirements may include a practical learning project, you are not required to participate in a project that is sponsored by an outside third party. Prior to your participation in a project sponsored by an outside third party, we would like you to carefully consider that your participation (i) may require you to assign your intellectual property (IP) rights to any intellectual property for which a student would retain ownership under the University’s Policy I.A.1 on Intellectual Property and/or (ii) may require you sign a non-disclosure (confidentiality) agreement with the sponsor. If you sign an agreement regarding intellectual property rights or a non-disclosure agreement, you may incur personal liability (with respect to breach of a non- disclosure agreement) or you may lose economic benefits associated with your ownership of intellectual property (with respect to a license or assignment of intellectual property). You are encouraged to retain independent legal counsel for advice on these types of agreements. In addition, if you choose not to sign a non-disclosure or intellectual property rights agreement, you may be reassigned to a different project or you may not be able to participate in The Data Mine Corporate Partners. 

=== Confidentiality of The Data Mine Corporate Partner Projects 

It is important to note that you are working on real-world problems that your Corporate Partner is trying to solve. These projects weren't created as busywork to keep you occupied for 9 months; you have the opportunity to make a real impact with your Corporate Partner. Past work from Data Mine students have been put into production code! 

With that being said, *the work you do and the data you have access to must be kept fully confidential!* Nearly all Corporate Partner students will be required to sign an NDA and/or IP agreement with the company. Even if you do not have to sign an NDA for your project, please keep the project details private. While each NDA will have unique terms, some basics include:

•	Do not move or copy the data from the original storage. Never email data, text it to your teammates, copy it to Slack, or put it in Google drive (or any other cloud storage system). For example, if the data lives on Scholar or Brown, do not move it off Scholar or Brown and _do not move it to a different folder._ 
•	Do not share any screenshots of the data or any findings (graphs, pictures, etc.) from the project with those who are not on your team. 
•	You cannot share things you learn from the data with anyone who is not working on the project. This includes your roommate, your parents, and your best friend. 
•	Do not disclose project specifics to anyone, including:
o	In an interview for an internship or job
o	On your LinkedIn profile
o	Your family/friends/roommate/boyfriend/girlfriend/professor 
•	Do not discuss the details of projects when you are in a public space. You should find a private place to join the weekly online team meetings. Also, be careful working on the project in a public space when others could walk by and see your screen. 
•	If you ever have questions about what you *can* talk about, always ask your Corporate Partner Mentor first. 
If you’re ever in doubt about what to share it’s often best to not share initially and check with your corporate partner. They can help clarify any confusion.’




== Agile

xref:agile-training.adoc[Click here to view the Agile Training and Resources]


The Data Mine will be applying Agile project management to all of our Corporate Partner projects. Nearly all of our Corporate Partners use Agile methods at their workplace. Agile allows complex projects to be broken down into small manageable tasks that can be assigned to individuals or teams. Agile also has built-in processes that help to enable team communication and collaboration. 

Many corporations utilize Agile in environments from software development to data science. While the specifics of each Agile practice may vary by corporation it is beneficial to understand the high-level architecture of the Agile practices and how they can be beneficial in a team development environment. Agile implementation specifics may differ by team. However, each team will be working toward the same goals focused on the breakdown and accomplishment of work tasks and the constant open collaboration between team members. 

To become more familiar with Agile methodologies you will complete online training and interactive team training focused on Agile. You will also take a quiz on applying Agile to The Data Mine. Since The Data Mine Corporate Partners is a learning environment (and not your typical 8 AM - 5 PM workplace), we have modified some of the practice to best suit the student schedule. 

The Linear application will also be available to teams for task tracking. The Data Mine staff will provide resources on the use of Linear and how it related to the Agile concepts in the materials above. The tool that the team utilizes for Agile task tracking can be determined on a project-by-project basis between the students and the corporate mentor or TA.  



== Attendance Policy 

This course follows Purdue’s academic regulations regarding attendance, *which states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled.* Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class and lateness will be noted. Students should stay home and contact the Protect Purdue Health Center (496-INFO) if they feel ill, have any symptoms associated with COVID-19, or suspect they have been exposed to the virus. 

When conflicts or absences can be anticipated, such as for many University-sponsored activities and religious observations, the student should inform the instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible. 

For unanticipated or emergency absences when advance notification to the instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible by email or phone. When the student is unable to make direct contact with the instructor and is unable to leave word with the instructor’s department because of circumstances beyond the student’s control, and in cases falling under excused absence regulations, the student or the student’s representative should contact or go to the Office of the Dean of Students website to complete appropriate forms for instructor notification. Under academic regulations, excused absences may be granted for cases of grief/bereavement, military service, jury duty, and parenting leave. For details, see the link:https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=13&navoid=15965#a-attendance[Academic Regulations & Student Conduct section] of the University Catalog website.
