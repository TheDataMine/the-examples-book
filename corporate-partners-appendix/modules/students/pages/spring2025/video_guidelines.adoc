= Video Deliverables 
** The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._ 

[IMPORTANT]
====
These posters and videos will be shared *publicly* during the Symposium. It is essential that students Work closely with their Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared without violating any NDAs. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium.

== 3 Minute Thesis

The video presentation will follow the format of the 3 Minute Thsis (3MT). 

Think of the 3MT as an elevator pitch for your project. Imagine you just came out of lab, you walk into an elevator, and someone joins you and asks, "What class are you getting out of?" You say Data Mine lab, and this person asks, "Oh, tell me about the work you're doing."  You have just 180 seconds to explain the complex research and project work your team has completed since the beginning of the term. AND this person likely does not have a technical background. 

That's the whole idea of the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT), to succinctly describe a research topic in a way that engages the listener and leaves them with a better understanding of:
** The Why ** – why is this research important?
** The What ** – what is the relevant background information?
** The Impact ** – how does this connect back to the average person or greater society? 

== Guidelines for the 3MT

* You must use a single static PowerPoint slide with no transitions or animations.
** You cannot use your poster as the slide.
* You are limited to 3 minutes maximum.
** 2 minutes minimum.
* You must have your camera on when recording your 3MT.
* Presentations are to be spoken word (e.g. no poems, raps or songs)

== Where did The Three Minute Thesis (3MT(R)) come from?

The Three Minute Thesis is an annual public speaking competition at many universities, inviting researchers to succinctly articulate the impact and breadth of their research within a 3-minute timeframe, targeting a non-specialist audience. Originating from the University of Queensland in 2008, this innovative contest has rapidly expanded its reach, now captivating audiences in over 85 countries worldwide!

== Expectations

*All students must contribute to the 3MT, but likely in different roles.*

* Here are some examples of different roles the students can fill(as well as added suggestions): 

* One or more students can brainstorm ideas and bring together the storytelling presentation components. (See "How to Write a Winning 3MT Script" below)
* One student can assemble the single PowerPoint slide to be used. It is recommended that you add visuals to your slide and limit text. (See "How to design and impactful 3MT slide" below)
* One or more students can write the script for the 3MT. (See "How to Write a Winning 3MT Script" below)
** Make sure to practice reading it to ensure it fits within the required time.
* One or two students can create the video recording and voice over.
* One student can do any necessary video editing and add the closed captions.
*Work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared.*
** The Data Mine will send all videos to review the company’s legal team before posting for the Symposium

== Due Dates

[TIP]
====
*Drafts* of the poster and video due *Wednesday, March 6, 2024*.

====

== A submitted 3MT video draft includes:
* 1 slide

**TAs will submit the drafts (one per team).**

== Script Guidelines
* Use an attention-grabbing hook to engage your audience from the start.
* Implement storytelling using the ABT (And, But, Therefore) template.
* Try tools like analogies, humor, and characters to enhance engagement.
* Eliminate technical jargon to ensure clarity for all listeners.
* Conclude your story by bringing it full circle (back to the hook), leaving a lasting impression on your audience

== Slide Guidelines
* Cannot  use your poster as a slide. 
* Consider simple graphs and data - consider it a graphical abstract that represents the project. 
* Opt for eye-catching images, creating your own if necessary.
* Minimize text to convey key points succinctly.
* Embrace negative space, allowing for visual balance and emphasis on essential elements.

== Video Guidelines
* The 3MT video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project.
* Any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results.
* Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion at the Symposium.
* Length anywhere between 2 - 3 minutes
* Include closed captioning (details below)
* Include an inset of the person speaking on the video recording
