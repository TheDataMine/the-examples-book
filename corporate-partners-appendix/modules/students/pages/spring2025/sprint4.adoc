  </div>
    <p><b>Why: </b> The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a widely-used tool for measuring implicit biases by assessing reaction times in sorting tasks. It reveals how quickly we associate concepts like race or gender with positive or negative attributes. The IAT demonstrates that implicit biases are pervasive and statistically significant, even though the effect sizes are small. Despite its effectiveness, the IAT has limitations, such as the potential for variability in individual responses. Understanding these biases is crucial for addressing their impact on behavior and promoting equity. </p>
