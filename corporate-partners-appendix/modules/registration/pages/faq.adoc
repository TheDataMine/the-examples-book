*I’ve read through the project descriptions, and I have picked which one I want to be on. How do I register?*  

See the xref:howtoregister.adoc[How to Register] page to see the registration tutorial.  

*I want to register for a team, but the project description says “*Registration: Instructor approval required”. What should I do?*  

Some projects will have a note “*Registration: Instructor approval required”. This means there are additional requirements or background experience needed.  

If you want to be on one of these teams, please submit an instructor approval override on registration. In the notes section of the override, you must include any relevant information required to be on the team. 

  

*Where does the LAB meet?* 

The 1 hour 50 minute “lab” portion of the course will meet in-person. During this time, you will meet with your student group to work on the project.  

*What does “SYNC ONLINE” mean for the LEC?*

The 50 minute “lec” portion of the course will meet synchronously online via Zoom because most Corporate Partner Mentors are not located near the West Lafayette area. This is your weekly team meeting with your Corporate Partner Mentor (employee at the company).  

*I want to register for a team, but I have a conflict with another course. What can I do?* 

First, you should reach out to your academic advisor to see if there are alternative meeting times or substitute courses you could switch to.  

If there are not any other options, you will have to pick another team. By the end of summer, there will be 75+ projects to choose from.  

_Course conflicts with the meeting times will not be approved._  You must be able to attend *both* meetings as listed in the course catalog.
