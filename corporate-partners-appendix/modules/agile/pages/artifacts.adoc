== Important Definitions
*Product Backlog*: the primary list of work that needs to be accomplished

*Sprint Backlog*: the list of tasks or items that the development team pulls from the product backlog to complete during a xref:ceremonies.adoc[sprint]

*Increment*: the useable end-product from a xref:ceremonies.adoc[sprint], also known as the sprint goal

== Artifacts in The Data Mine
Scrum artifacts will be great tools for all Data Mine teams to deploy. Corporate Partner Mentors and TAs will manage the *product backlog* while the student team will manage the *sprint backlog*. The combination of well-managed product and sprint backlogs will lead to efficient *increments*, and ultimately a smooth project.

The most important feature of sprint artifacts is their visibility. All team members must have access to the changes occurring on the backlogs. To assist with visibility, some tools to consider include:

* MS Teams Planner which can be integrated right into your teams group!

Which tool you select depends on your team size and corporate partner access.
