== Important Definitions
*Product Backlog*: the primary list of work that needs to be accomplished

*Sprint Backlog*: the list of tasks or items that the development team pulls from the product backlog to complete during a xref:ceremonies.adoc[sprint]

*Increment*: the useable end-product from a xref:ceremonies.adoc[sprint], also known as the sprint goal

== Artifacts in The Data Mine
Scrum artifacts will be great tools for all Data Mine teams to deploy. Corporate Partner Mentors and TAs will manage the *sprint backlog* while the student team will manage the *sprint backlog*. The combination of well-managed product and sprint backlogs will lead to efficient *increments*, and ultimately a smooth project.

Which tool you select depends on your team size and corporate partner access.
