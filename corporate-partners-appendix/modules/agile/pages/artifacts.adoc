== Artifacts in The Data Mine
Scrum artifacts will be great tools for all Data Mine teams to deploy. Corporate Partner Mentors and TAs will manage the sprint backlog while the student team will manage the sprint backlog. The combination of well-managed product and sprint backlogs will lead to efficient increments, and ultimately a smooth project.

The most important feature of sprint artifacts is their visibility. All team members must have access to the changes occurring on the backlogs. To assist with visibility, some tools to consider are Trello, Asana, and Jira. Which tool you select depends on your team size and corporate partner access. 

To understand when these artifacts are put in use, lets now learn about scrum ceremonies.
