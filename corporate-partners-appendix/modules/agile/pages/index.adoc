== Introduction to PMI's Project Management
Project management is a structured approach to navigating a project to achieve certain goals. The PMI (Project Management Institute) outlines five distinct process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Understanding and effectively implementing these process groups can significantly enhance the chances of project success.

=== 1. Initiating
The Initiating process group lays the foundation for the project. It involves defining the project's goals, getting formal authorization, and identifying key stakeholders. This phase ensures that the project aligns with the organization’s goals.

In the DataMine, this would look like creating/reviewing the project charter, signing the NDAs and meeting with your project mentor to understand the goals and objectives of the project.

Importance: This phase is important as expectations need to be set and understood from the very beginning as they can make or break a project.

=== 2. Planning
Planning involves developing a detailed roadmap for achieving the project’s goals. It includes defining the project scope, setting milestones, estimating costs, and planning for risks and communications. This process group emphasizes the importance of thorough planning to prevent chaos during execution.

In the DataMine, planning involves creating a Team Contract to set rules, regulations and expectation on how the team would work together. Additionally during the agile sprint planning phase, which occurs at the beginning of every sprint, goals are moved from the product backlog to the sprint backlog.

Importance: This phase is important as it aids prepare for challanges/conflicts and adds structure to the project.  

=== 3. Executing
The Executing process group is where the project work is carried out. It involves coordinating people and resources to produce the project deliverables. Effective team management and stakeholder engagement are critical here.

In the DataMine, the scrum master is your Corporte Partners TA and your Product owner is your Corporate Partners Mentor. The TA is the bridge between the mentor and team which means that they need to direct the team by collecting and providing resources and communicating mentor's project expectation to the team. It is crucial that there is strong communication and collaboration between the team, the TA and the mentor.  

Importance: The lack of strong communication between the team, TA and mentor would lead to a lack of vision/perspective on project goals and objectives.

=== 4. Monitoring and Controlling
This process group involves tracking the project’s progress and making necessary adjustments to stay on track. It ensures that project objectives are met by comparing actual performance with the plan and implementing corrective actions as needed.

In the DataMine, during the sprint review, the team discusses whether the tasks worked on during that sprint can be marked as complete or whether to move them back into the sprint backlog. In the sprint retrospective, the team reflects on the sprint to understand areas of improvement and areas of success.

Importance: Periodic reflection is crucial as it helps assess whether the team's progress and outcomes are aligning with the mentor's expectation and overall project goals.

=== 5. Closing
The Closing process group ensures that the project is completed properly. It involves formal acceptance of the project deliverables, releasing project resources, and documenting lessons learned.

In the DataMine, all teams are required to work on documentation throughout the year. Each team also has a documentation manager to make sure everyone on the team is on track with their documentation.

Importance: Documenting your work is essential because it allows the product owner to access, review, and utilize the information both during and after the project, ensuring continuity and facilitating knowledge transfer.

In closing, implementing these five process groups diligently can significantly enhance project success. This creates a structured approach that helps manage complexity and uncertainty.
