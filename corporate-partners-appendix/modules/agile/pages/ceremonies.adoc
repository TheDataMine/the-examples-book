== Important Definitions

*Sprint*: the time period where the scrum team works together to accomplish their xref:artifacts.adoc[increment]

*Sprint Planning*: meeting time spent planning for the upcoming sprint including task ownership and xref:artifacts.adoc[increment] decisions

*Daily Scrums*: short (5-15 minute), daily check ins where each team member speaks very briefly on what they are working on and notify the team of any blockers they are facing

*Sprint Review*: a meeting held towards the end of a sprint to demo the xref:artifacts.adoc[increment] and reorganize the xref:artifacts.adoc[product backlog] 

*Sprint Retrospective*: a meeting with the scrum team spent reflecting on what what went well during the previous sprint and what can be improved upon for next sprint 

== Ceremonies in The Data Mine
Using *scrum ceremonies* may be the single most important part of using scrum in The Data Mine. It is normal to seek structure in project development, but it is often very hard to find with research and development projects. Scrum ceremonies offer that structure.

By committing to a regular and consistent schedule, scrum teams will find themselves in a steady groove as the project unfolds. 

=== Sprint Planning

*Sprint planning* should take place at the start of every sprint. Realistically, planning meetings will occur at the first team meeting following the end of sprint. TAs are responsible for creating and maintaining the xref:artifacts.adoc[product backlog] by working with their team’s corporate partner mentor to ensure they project is moving with correct pace and direction.

During the *sprint planning meeting*, an open discussion is held between the corporate partner mentors, TAs, and development team. Each development team member will take ownership of tasks from the xref:artifacts.adoc[product backlog] to complete the coming sprint. Each event that is chosen will then be moved to xref:artifacts.adoc[sprint backlog].

=== Sprint Review

*Sprint reviews* should occur once every sprint during a meeting time with the team’s corporate partner mentor in attendance. Team members will go around and informally demonstrate their work through live demos, documentation, or presentations. This meeting is where the corporate partner mentor can clearly see the work being done by the team and can give feedback to the team. It is crucial for the team to be prepared for these meetings on a sprint-by-sprint basis because it is direct representation of the work being accomplished. Feedback from the corporate partner mentor should be annotated and applied towards the next sprint.

=== Sprint Retrospective

*Retrospectives* in The Data Mine function as a standard retrospective. This ceremony will happen at the end of every sprint and is a time for reflection and evaluation of the sprint. This event can be held with or without a corporate partner mentor, and it is the TA’s responsibility to lead this ceremony.
