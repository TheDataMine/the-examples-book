== Ceremonies in The Data Mine
Using scrum ceremonies may be the single most important part of using scrum in The Data Mine. It is normal to seek structure in project development, but it is often very hard to find with research and development projects. Scrum ceremonies offer that structure.

By committing to a regular and consistent schedule, scrum teams will find themselves in a steady groove as the project unfolds. 

=== Sprint Planning

Sprint planning should take place at the start of every sprint. Realistically, planning meetings will occur at the first team meeting following the end of sprint. TAs are responsible for creating and maintaining the product backlog by working with their team’s corporate partner mentor to ensure they project is moving with correct pace and direction.

During the sprint planning meeting, an open discussion is held between the corporate partner mentors, TAs, and development team. Each development team member will take ownership of tasks from the product backlog to complete the coming sprint. Each event that is chosen will then be moved to sprint backlog.

=== Sprint Review

Sprint reviews should occur once every sprint during a meeting time with the team’s corporate partner mentor in attendance. Team members will go around and informally demonstrate their work through live demos, documentation, or presentations. This meeting is where the corporate partner mentor can clearly see the work being done by the team and can give feedback to the team. It is crucial for the team to be prepared for these meetings on a sprint-by-sprint basis because it is direct representation of the work being accomplished. Feedback from the corporate partner mentor should be annotated and applied towards the next sprint.

=== Sprint Retrospective

Retrospectives in The Data Mine function as a standard retrospective. This ceremony will happen at the end of every sprint and is a time for reflection and evaluation of the sprint. This event can be held with or without a corporate partner mentor, and it is the TA’s responsibility to lead this ceremony.
