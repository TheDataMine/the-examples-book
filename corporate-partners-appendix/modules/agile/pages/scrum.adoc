== Scrum in the data mine
The Data Mine Corporate Partners cohort has a goal for all projects to follow the scrum framework. We are confident the structured flexibility of Scrum will allow for each development team to tailor its execution of scrum to their needs. 

There is not a “one size fits all” approach to Scrum, but with preparation, communication, transparency, practice, and dedication, the Scrum framework may prove to guide your projects toward a successful outcome.
