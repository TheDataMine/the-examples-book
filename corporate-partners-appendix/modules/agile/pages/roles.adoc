== Roles in The Data Mine
The Data Mine has a natural definition of who takes on what roles within a scrum team.

Corporate partner mentors take on the role of *product owner* because of their direct connection to the business. They are the leader of a project and will be the decision maker for project scope and direction.

TAs perform the work of a *scrum master* and are the bridge between CP mentors and Purdue students. They establish agile management and teach scrum to the team. TAs also help CP mentors with project management.

The Data Mine students make up the *development team* and are the owners of any project development tasks. Students are the primary contributors to projects and perform the actions necessary to work towards the project goal.
