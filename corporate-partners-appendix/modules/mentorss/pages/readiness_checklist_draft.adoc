= Readiness Checklist

During the 25 minutes bi-weekly meetings, we plan to discuss the specifics of your project(s). The checklist includes some general topics we will be discussing.

== Project Description
*Have we received the project description?*

The project description provides a high-level overview of the project. Students will review and decide to register to a team.

* xref:project_descriptions.adoc[Project Description]

== Legal and Funding
*Are you working with your legal team to finalize the Sponsorship Acknowledgment?*

We want to ensure both parties agree on the legal and funding logistics. This process might take some time thus we suggest our corporate partners start early in the summer.

* xref:legal.adoc[Legal and Funding]

== Data
*How will the students acquired the data?*

One of the most important aspects of a data science project is, of course, the data! It is essential to understand how the students will obtain the data and plan for potential obstacles (account set up, data requests, transfer to RCAC data depot, etc.). We want the students can access to the data near the beginning of the semester!

*Is the data complex enough for the project?*

A data project will not be intense enough if the data only contains a few observations and a handful of variables. We can discuss this topic in more detail with one of our Senior Data Scientists.

== Hardware/Software
*What are some required software and hardware?*

To work on the projects, the students need to know what they will be using to accomplish the tasks. We will discuss specifics tools you may have and what students have access to in The Data Mine.

== Syllabus
*Roadmap to help prepare the students*

A syllabus will be the go-to reference for the project; this will help the students understand the company, the purpose of the project, the timeline, and other expectations.

== Mentor
*Have you identify a committed personnel within your company to serve as the product owner and oversee the project?*

Our students thrive with the help of an engaging mentor. This personnel does not have to be a data scientist, but we encourage this individual to be attentive and support the students the best they can. Past corporate partner mentors have served as the domain expert, technical expert, or both!

* xref:best_practice_draft.adoc[Mentor Best Practices]

== Goals/Milestones
*Roadmap on timeline for expected outcomes*

In this topic, we will discuss potential outcomes for the project. Again, the corporate partners learning community is an experiential learning community; we do not guarantee a deliverable at the end of the academic year. With that being said, we encourage mentors to have expectations to provide structure to the project.


== Other questions
*What support do you need from The Data Mine?*

*Potential Preferences*

* Project management tool (E.g. Linear)
* Code management (E.g. GitHub)
* Documentation format (E.g. Wiki)
