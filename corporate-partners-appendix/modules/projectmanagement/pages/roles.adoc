== Scrum Practice: Team (People)
The *Scrum Team* is at the heart of every Scrum project. It brings together different roles—*Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team*—each with clear responsibilities that help the project move forward. In The Data Mine, these roles are reflected in mentors, TAs, and students, with support from subject matter experts when needed.
