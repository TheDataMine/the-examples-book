In Sprint 5 Professional Development, the team completed the Tuckman’s Model Review. This lab discussion is a brief follow-up to compare perspectives, agree on the current stage, and identify one action step.

*Discussion guidance:*

* Start by asking: _Where are we as a team right now? How do we function together?_
* Have each member share which stage they selected and briefly explain their reasoning — do they agree or disagree?
* As a group decide on the stage (by vote or count) and identify one collective action step, drawing from their Professional Development assignment or new ideas, to help maintain or reach the Performing stage.
* Ask one team member to share a short summary _(stage & action step)_ in the team channel during or after lab. 

Due: **Post on Team Channel by the end of the day of the lab.**
