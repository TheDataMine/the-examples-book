= Team Contract  

As the TA, you are responsible for ensuring your student team has a clear understanding of the expectations for both your project and The Data Mine. To support this, we have implemented the creation of a Team Contract for each team to agree upon shared norms. It is essential that you guide your team through the process of following and completing the team contract outline. This document will establish the standards and expectations for the year and will be referenced frequently to maintain alignment and accountability.
