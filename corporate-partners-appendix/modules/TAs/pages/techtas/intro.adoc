= Technical TAs

In this section, you will learn about The Data Mine's expectations for technical TAs surrounding communication, documentation, planning, check-ins, and more. It is extremely *important* for you to read, *understand*, and *apply* the information. Following the expectations will help to ensure a positive, smooth semester.

Please return to this section as many times as needed. If you have questions, please ask in the TA group chat or at TA meetings, or contact your Data Science Liaison. 

This section also consists of tools and resources developed for Technical TAs.
