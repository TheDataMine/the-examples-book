= Introduction Expectations

Welcome to the Expectations branch.
In this section, you will learn about The Data Mine's expectations for TAs surrounding communication, documentation, planning, grading, check-ins, and more. It is extremely *important* for you to read, *understand*, and *apply* the information. Following the expectations will help to ensure a positive, smooth semester. 

Please return to this section as many times as needed. If you have questions, please ask in the TA group chat or at TA meetings, email your head TA, or contact The Data Mine staff at datamine@purdue.edu. 

After reviewing expectations, it is recommended to look through the xref:resources/introduction_resources.adoc[resources] branch as it has many tools developed for TAs.
