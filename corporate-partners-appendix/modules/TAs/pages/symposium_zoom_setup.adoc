3. Fill out the meeting information as below (see screenshot below): 
- *Topic*: Use your team name followed by DM CRP Symposium (ex. Merck – DM CRP Symposium)
- *When*: Wednesday, April 20, 2022. Select start time to be 2:00 PM ET so it is ready to start the Zoom room early. The Symposium will officially start at 2:30 PM ET. 
- *Duration*: Select 3 hours (2:00 PM – 5:00 PM ET to allow flexibility even though it should last from 2:30-4:30 PM). 
- *Meeting ID*: Select “Generate Automatically” to add additional layer of security. Do *not* select personal meeting room. 
- *Security*: Enable the passcode. 
- *Meeting Options*: Allow participants to join before start time. Also select “mute participants upon entry” since people will be joining at any time between 2:30-4:30 PM so we don’t want them to interrupt the conversation. 
- *Alternative Hosts*: Add a student on your team as a secondary host option in case of technical difficulties on the day of the symposium. Enter their email to add them as a secondary host.

== Setting changes to protect your meeting
Under Settings > In Meeting (Basic), turn *off* Annotation, Whiteboard, and Remote Control. This prevents Zoom “bombers” or others with malicious intent from taking over the meeting.
