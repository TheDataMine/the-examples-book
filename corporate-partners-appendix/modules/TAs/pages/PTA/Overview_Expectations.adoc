= Portfolio Teaching Assistant (PTA)

== Role Overview 

Portfolio Teaching Assistants (PTAs) are assigned a portfolio of student project teams each semester. Their primary responsibility is to provide ongoing support to Teaching Assistants (TAs) and student teams by facilitating communication, identifying challenges, and connecting teams with appropriate resources. PTAs are not expected to resolve all technical issues directly but should be knowledgeable about available support channels (e.g., Data Science Team, Corporate Partner Advisors). 

PTAs are required to submit weekly status reports and participate in regular meetings with The Data Mine (TDM) staff to ensure project progress and address any concerns. 

== Key Responsibilities

   - Conduct weekly lab visits for each assigned team. 

   - Check in with TAs and student teams to assess progress and identify any obstacles. 

   - Monitor team activity via MS Teams, including reviewing Kanban boards. 

   - Ensure TAs are actively assigning and managing student tasks. 

   - Facilitate connections between teams and relevant support resources. 

   - Submit support tickets to datamine-help@purdue.edu as needed. 

   - Prepare and submit weekly status reports via SharePoint, including: 

   - A summary of each team’s status. 

   - A color-coded assessment: 

   - Green – Project is on track; no concerns. 

   - Yellow – Project is at risk; minor concerns (e.g., technical or knowledge gaps, unclear direction). 

   - Red – Project is off track; major concerns (e.g., lack of progress, team morale issues, missing data, TA disengagement). 

   - Attend mandatory weekly meetings with TDM staff. 

   - Participate in monthly TA meetings. 

   - Conduct at least one 1:1 check-in with each TA per month.
