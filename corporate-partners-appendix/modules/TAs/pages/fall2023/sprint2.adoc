= Sprint #2

== Intro Video

*Insert Video Here*

== Sprint Dates
All sprints will have the same due dates, but the sprint start and end dates are slightly shifted depending on when a team has their lab (2 hours) and lecture (50 minutes). This is so that sprints always start with a lec and follow the format lec-lab-lec-lab.

You can find a xref:fall2023/schedule.adoc#sprint-schedule[visual of the sprint schedule here]. More details will be covered in the agile training below.
