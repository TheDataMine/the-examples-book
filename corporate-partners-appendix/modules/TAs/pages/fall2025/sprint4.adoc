[[complete-time-sheet]]
=== &#10003; Complete Time Sheet 

Timesheet #8 is due on Sunday, October 19, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET, and Timesheet #9 is due on Sunday, October 26, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET. Please submit through Success Factors or via Excel if you are in the credit-based TA role.

[[professional-development]]
=== &#10003; Grade Professional Development #3 

Please grade the Professional Development #3 assignment on Gradescope. As you review, pay close attention to Psychological Safety Point 2: Applying the Team Contract, and note during mentor meetings or labs whether students have started implementing the norm they chose to practice.

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday, October 15, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET.**

[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003; Grade Sprint Report #3 
The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. For Sprint #3, we added a "Showcase Work You’re Proud Of" section (mid-semester feedback) alongside Self-Evaluation and Implementation Check. This gives students a space to highlight their progress and provides Mentors and you (TAs) with additional context for offering meaningful feedback.

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.
- **Showcase Work You’re Proud Of** highlights the work students feel most proud of, giving insight into their progress and what they value in their contributions.
- **Implementation Check** shows how students put into practice the tasks connected to Professional Development.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team.

**Note**: Please complete this report after grading Sprint Report #3 submissions.
