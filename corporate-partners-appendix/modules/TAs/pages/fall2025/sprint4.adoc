[[complete-time-sheet]]
=== ✓ Complete Time Sheet 

Timesheet {timesheet8-due} and {timesheet9-due}. Please submit through Success Factors or via Excel if you are in the credit-based TA role.

---

[[professional-development]]
=== ✓ Grade Professional Development #{previous-sprint}

Please grade the Professional Development # {previous-sprint} assignment on Gradescope. As you review, pay close attention to Psychological Safety Point 2: Applying the Team Contract, and note during mentor meetings or labs whether students have started implementing the norm they chose to practice.

Due: on **Gradescope by {pd-due}.**

---

[[sprint-report]]
=== ✓ Grade Sprint Report #{previous-sprint}

The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. For Sprint #3, we added a "Showcase Work You're Proud Of" section (mid-semester feedback) alongside Self-Evaluation and Implementation Check. This gives students a space to highlight their progress and provides Mentors and you (TAs) with additional context for offering meaningful feedback.

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.
- **Mid-Semester Checkpoint** highlights the work students feel most proud of, giving insight into their progress and what they value in their contributions. Students also relect on their team's core values, which can inform you of team dynamics and areas for growth.
- **Implementation Check** shows how students put into practice the tasks connected to Professional Development.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team and program.
