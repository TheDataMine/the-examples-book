== Sprint Timeline (Detailed Descriptions)


[[complete-time-sheet]]
=== ✓ Complete Time Sheet 

Timesheet {timesheet8-due} and {timesheet9-due}. Please submit through Success Factors or via Excel if you are in the credit-based TA role.

[[professional-development]]
=== ✓ Grade Professional Development #{previous-sprint}

Please grade the Professional Development # {previous-sprint} assignment on Gradescope. As you review, pay close attention to Psychological Safety Point 2: Applying the Team Contract, and note during mentor meetings or labs whether students have started implementing the norm they chose to practice.

Due: on **Gradescope by {pd-due}.**

[[sprint-report]]
=== ✓ Grade Sprint Report #{previous-sprint}

The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. For Sprint #3, we added a "Showcase Work You’re Proud Of" section (mid-semester feedback) alongside Self-Evaluation and Implementation Check. This gives students a space to highlight their progress and provides Mentors and you (TAs) with additional context for offering meaningful feedback.

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.
- **Showcase Work You’re Proud Of** highlights the work students feel most proud of, giving insight into their progress and what they value in their contributions.
- **Implementation Check** shows how students put into practice the tasks connected to Professional Development.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team.
====

Due: on **Gradescope by {report3-due}**

[[complete-team-report]]
=== ✓ Complete Team Report #{previous-sprint}

This report captures your responsibilities as a TA (Scrum Master) and your team’s progress in Sprint  {previous-sprint}. It helps you reflect on what has been completed, what still needs attention, and what’s next. It also provides your liaison with the context they need to offer support.  
**Note**: Please complete this report after grading Sprint Report #3 submissions.

Due: on **Gradescope by {teamreport3-due}**

[[mid-meeting]]
=== ✓ Mid-Semester Feedback with Mentor

Set up a meeting with your mentor to complete your mid-semester feedback. Mid-Semester Evaluations are due **{mid-semester-due}**. You can begin this assignment during this sprint. Be sure to share the rubric with your mentor early so they have time to prepare:

[[check-ins]]
=== ✓ Semester Check Ins

Complete TA and Student 1:1 Check-Ins – This task is flexible and can be completed anytime during Sprint {sprint}. Schedule time with each team member for an individual check-in to see how they are doing and provide support. For more guidance, review:
