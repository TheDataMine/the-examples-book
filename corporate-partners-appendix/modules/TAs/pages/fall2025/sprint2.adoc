[[complete-team-report]]
=== &#10003; Complete Team Report #1

This report captures your responsibilities as a TA (Scrum Master) and your team’s progress in Sprint 1. It helps you reflect on what has been completed, what still needs attention, and what’s next. It also provides your liaison with the context they need to offer support.

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday 09/24 at 11:59PM EST**

[[professional-development]]
=== &#10003; Grade Professional Development #1 

Please grade the Professional Development #1 assignment on Gradescope. As you review, pay close attention to the steps each student identified in the Meeting Expectations section from **_Are You Participating in Meetings Effectively?_**, and note whether they have started putting these steps into practice during mentor meetings.

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday, September 17, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET.**

[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003; Grade Sprint Report #1 .
The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. It is divided into two sections: Self-Evaluation and Reflection.

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.

- **Reflection** shows how students are connecting their experiences to project practices and the program.

**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team.

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday 09/24 at 11:59PM EST**

[[team-contract]]
=== &#10003; Team Contract
The Team Contract is a key tool for setting expectations, building accountability, and strengthening collaboration. As the TA (Scrum Master), guide the process so every team member contributes and agrees on the commitments.

- **Before Lab #1**: Review the Team Contract instructions linked xref:TAs:team_contract.adoc[here].

- **During Lab #1**: Facilitate a team discussion using the contract as a guide.

- **Submission**: Upload the completed Team Contract to **Gradescope by Friday, September 26, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET**. Ensure all sections have been discussed and signed virtually by every team member.
