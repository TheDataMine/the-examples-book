The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. 

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.
- **Mid-Semester Checkpoint** highlights the work students feel most proud of, giving insight into their progress and what they value in their contributions. Students also relect on their team's core values, which can inform you of team dynamics and areas for growth.
- **Implementation Check** shows how students put into practice the tasks connected to Professional Development.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team and program.
