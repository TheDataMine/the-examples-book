== Overview & Purpose

Navigate to {student-version-link} to review requirements and the official rubric.  

As a TA, your role is to help your team stay on track through each milestone — from creating the presentation outline to delivering the final talk.  
The information below will help you guide your team through each stage of preparation and submission.

== Mentor Coordination

Before your team begins developing the presentation, discuss the following details with your mentor.  

* **Who is attending?**  
  Confirm by *Sprint 5* which guests or partners will join the Final Fall Presentation.  
  This allows your team to tailor introductions, visuals, and content appropriately.

* **What content is appropriate to show?**  
  Some project details may be confidential — check with your mentor to confirm what can be shared in the presentation.

Once these details are confirmed, your focus shifts to helping your team plan its **content, slides, speaking roles, and deadlines**,  
as outlined in the **timeline below.**

[#stage1]
== Stage 1: Draft Presentation Development 

*During Sprints 5–6*, this stage focuses on helping the team plan and build the first version of their Final Presentation.
As the TA, your role is to guide the team through story development, defining speaking roles, and beginning slide creation.
---

[#discussion]
=== Presentation Discussion (Required)  
*Sprint 5 – Lab 1* 

**Purpose**  +
This first lab introduces presentation quality. It helps the team identify what makes presentations effective and what to avoid.

*Use this PowerPoint to facilitate the discussion:*  
{worst-presentation-ppt}

**How to Run This Lab**

1. Open and share the “World’s Worst Presentation Ever” slides.  
2. Play through each example and ask students to identify problems — too much text, weak visuals, poor flow, or lack of focus.  
3. Lead a brief reflection discussion:  
   * What made this presentation difficult to follow?  
   * What could be improved visually or structurally?  
   * What makes a presentation engaging in a professional setting?  
4. Record insights in a shared space (Teams notes or chat). These observations will guide the team in Lab 2.  
5. Conclude by agreeing on shared expectations for slide clarity, flow, and tone.

**TA Checklist – Sprint 5 Lab 1**

* [ ] Displayed and discussed "World’s Worst Presentation Ever." 
* [ ] Encouraged students to identify good and poor design elements.  
* [ ] Recorded team takeaways for next lab.  
* [ ] Reinforced expectations for professional presentation quality.

[#preparation]
=== Preparing for the Final Presentation (Required)
*Sprint 5: Lab 2*

**Purpose**  +
In this lab, the team begins shaping its **presentation outline** — defining story flow, speaker roles, and content ownership using the *Transformation Matrix* and *Data Storytelling Framework.*

*Refer to:*  
{student-version-link}

**How to Run This Lab** +
During the lab, guide the team as they combine these ideas into a shared framework that will shape their final presentation outline.

==== 1. Facilitate the Team Transformation Matrix

Each student has already completed an individual **Transformation Matrix** in *Professional Development #4* and should now have a clear understanding of the audience — informed by the mentor coordination discussion and details shared by the TA.  

Your role is to **facilitate and guide** the team in identifying common themes across their individual matrices and merging them into a single, shared version that reflects the **collective audience perspective** and message for the presentation.  

This combined matrix defines what the audience *knows, believes, feels,* and *does* **before and after** the presentation — and serves as the **foundation for the presentation outline.**  

Watch this short overview as a refresher if needed:  
{transformation}
 

*Display or share this template during lab:*

[frame=all, cols="4,4,4,4"]
|===
What they… | Before | → | After
| *Know* | | | 
| *Believe* | | | 
| *Feel* | | | 
| *Do* | | | 
|===

**Facilitation Tips** 

* Step 1 – Revisit the audience-insight discussion and list what the audience currently *knows, believes, feels,* and *does*.  
* Step 2 – Complete the “After” column in reverse order — what you want them to *do, feel, believe,* and *know* following the presentation.  
* Step 3 – Use the center **Transformation** column to determine what the team can *say, do,* or *show* to guide the audience from “Before” to “After”.  
* Encourage the use of sticky notes, comments, or PowerPoint notes — each box can hold multiple ideas. These transformation ideas form the foundation of the slide content.  
* Encourage collaborative brainstorming. Let the team visualize the "Before → After" transformation (e.g., sticky notes, bullet points in PowerPoint). Remind them that the **Transformation** column is not just theory — it directly informs the *content and sequence* of the slides.

↩ xref:#presentation-timeline[Back to Timeline]

---

==== 2. Apply the Data Storytelling Framework +
Each student explored storytelling individually in *Professional Development #4.*  
Now, help the team connect those reflections into one cohesive story — transforming project data into an engaging narrative.  
Watch this short overview as a refresher if needed: {story}  

Discuss how the team can merge their story with the Transformation Matrix by answering: 

1. *Setup:* What is the background or problem?  
2. *Conflict:* What challenge or insight drove the work?  
3. *Resolution:* What results or progress were achieved, and what’s next?  

---
==== 3. Set Up the Shared PowerPoint

* Have the team create a **shared PowerPoint Online deck** in your project channel.  
* Apply either the **Corporate Partner** or **Purdue-branded** template.  
* Name the file: `ProjectName_Fall2025_FinalPresentation.pptx`.  
* This serves as the *single source of truth* for slide development and speaker coordination.  

---
==== 4. Define Speaker Roles and Slide Ownership

* Assign who will build and present each section (refer to {roles} for the idea).  
* Document roles directly in the deck (hidden “Roles” slide or comments).  
* Encourage one **backup speaker** per major section.  
* Ensure all students contribute — through content, visuals, or delivery.  

[TIP]
====
When assigning speaking roles, match sections to comfort and interest levels.  
Aim for balanced participation and ensure all team members have editing access to the deck.
====

---

==== 5. Finalize the Outline
By the end of this lab, the team should have:  

* A completed **Transformation Matrix**  
* A clear **Setup → Conflict → Resolution** storyline  
* A **shared, branded PowerPoint deck**  
* Defined **speaker roles** and **slide ownership**

**TA Checklist – Sprint 5 Lab 2** 

* [ ] Facilitated the team Transformation Matrix discussion.  
* [ ] Helped integrate storytelling into the outline.  
* [ ] Verified shared PowerPoint deck and branding.  
* [ ] Documented speaker roles and assignments.  
* [ ] Confirmed outline completion before Sprint 6.  

↩ xref:#presentation-timeline[Back to Timeline]

[#slides]
=== Slide Preparation (Required)
*Sprint 6: Labs 1 & 2*

**Purpose**  +
During Sprint 6, the team transforms its outline into a professional, visually engaging draft deck.  
Your goal is to ensure cohesive design, consistent formatting, and clear story flow as the team builds toward the draft submission.
Refer to {outline} & {rubric-url} for details on key criteria and expectations for your final presentation.

**Draft Requirements**

* Presentation should be at least **60% complete**, with section flow and story outline visible.  
* Include **placeholder slides** where visuals, data, or demos will be added later.   
* Ensure **main ideas and transitions** are already established.  
* Outline visuals or notes in slides where final content is pending.

**How to Run This Lab** 

1. Review that the Transformation Matrix and outline are reflected in slide titles and flow.  
2. Encourage concise text and use of visuals (images, figures, graphs, screenshots).  
3. Review fonts, colors, and layout for consistency.  
4. Encourage students to use slide notes for speaker cues.  
5. Allocate time to test section transitions and timing.  

**Tips and Common Feedback** 
 
* Keep slides consistent – fonts, colors, and styles.  
* Use minimal text; communicate accomplishments visually.  
* Review past presentations in {ideas} 
    

**TA Checklist – Sprint 6** 

* [ ] Supported slide creation and ensured visual consistency.  
* [ ] Reviewed flow, transitions, and story alignment.  
* [ ] Ensured draft deck meets requirements.  

↩ xref:#presentation-timeline[Back to Timeline]

[#draft]
== Draft Submission – Submit Draft Slides  
*Due Date: November 19*

At the end of Sprint 6, the TA submits the **draft presentation deck** for TDM staff feedback.  

**TA Checklist – Draft Submission**

* [ ] Verified deck is ≈60% complete and logically structured.  
* [ ] Confirmed placeholders and notes for visuals or data are included.  
* [ ] Ensured correct naming and branding format.  
* [ ] Submitted draft by **November 19** for TDM staff feedback.  
* [ ] Reminded team to prepare for revisions after feedback.



---
[#stage2]
== Stage 2 – Final Presentation Refinement (Sprint 7)

During Sprint 7, the focus shifts from *building* to *completing and refining* the presentation.  
At this stage, your team should already have a structured draft (around 60% complete) from the previous sprint.
Your role as TA is to help the team finalize remaining content, incorporate feedback from TDM staff, polish the deck for professional delivery, and guide them through practice sessions to ensure clear timing, confident speaking, and smooth team transitions.

Your primary goals are to:

* Support the team in completing all missing visuals, data, or sections.  
* Ensure TDM staff feedback from the draft review is implemented.  
* Prepare the team for confident, clear delivery through rehearsal and timing practice.

[NOTE]
====
There may be *no Sprint 7 – Lab 1* due to the Thanksgiving break.  +
Since *Lab 2* time will be limited, discuss with your team outside of class approach —  
whether to focus on **completing remaining slides (40%)**, **TDM staff feedback**, or **scheduling a practice session after Lab 2**.  

Encourage them to stay coordinated and use this time wisely so there's enough opportunity for both **revision and rehearsal** before the final presentation.
====

---
[#revision]
=== Revision & Completion
*Sprint 7 – Lab 2*

**Purpose** + 
This lab focuses on *collaborative completion and improvement.*  
The TA and team work together to finish remaining content, apply mentor and staff feedback, and refine slides for a polished, professional presentation.

**How to Run This Lab**

1. Open the **draft presentation** (≈60% complete) and review all mentor and staff feedback together.  
2. Identify what content still needs to be developed or finalized — data visuals, results, speaker notes, or transition slides.  
3. Assign responsibilities for completing missing sections directly in the shared PowerPoint deck.  
4. Review all figures, metrics, and visuals for accuracy, clarity, and consistency.  
5. Ensure transitions and story flow connect naturally from setup → conflict → resolution.  
6. Confirm that speaking roles, timing, and slide ownership remain clear and balanced.  
7. Save updates frequently and note any mentor-specific questions for follow-up.

**Facilitation Tips**

* Keep the focus on *completion and refinement*, not major redesign.  
* Encourage short, structured feedback rounds (e.g., “two things to improve, one thing that works”).  
* Reinforce Purdue/Corporate Partner branding standards for a cohesive look.  
* Ensure the deck reflects clear story flow and consistent tone.  
* Remind the team that this version becomes the **final submission** for mentor review.  

**TA Checklist – Sprint 7 Lab 2**

* [ ] Reviewed mentor and staff feedback with the team.  
* [ ] Assigned and verified completion of all remaining slides and visuals.  
* [ ] Confirmed accuracy of figures, data, and transitions.  
* [ ] Rechecked speaker roles and slide timing.  
* [ ] Ensured the presentation is fully ready for final submission.

[#practice]
=== Practice Session  
Sprint 7 – Lab 2  

**Purpose**  +
Once the presentation has been refined, the team should conduct a *timed rehearsal* to ensure smooth delivery, flow, and confident speaking transitions.

**How to Run This Lab**

1. Have the full team join and share the final deck in presentation mode.  
2. Run a complete, timed run-through (30–40 minutes + Q&A).  
3. Note transitions, slide pacing, and areas that still feel rushed or uneven.  
4. Provide feedback on tone, clarity, and professionalism.   
5. Adjust slide content or order only if it clarifies flow — avoid major edits this late.

**Facilitation Tips**

* Keep rehearsal feedback constructive and specific.  
* Remind the team to speak naturally, not read slides verbatim.  
* Check that all speakers know how to advance slides and handle transitions.  
* Confirm that visuals and animations display correctly in presentation mode.  
* Record timing to ensure the talk fits within the allotted 50-minute meeting slot.

**TA Checklist – Practice Session**

== Expectations

Navigate to xref:students:fall2025/final_presentation.adoc[Final Presentation information] to review requirements and rubric. Students will also have access to these guidelines.

See below on how to prepare your team.

== How to Prepare Your Team

How do I prepare my team for the Final Fall Presentation?

There are a couple questions you need to answer before you can properly prepare your team for the presentation.

1. Find out from your mentor, who is coming to the Final Fall Presentation? It is important to have a list of of these people *by Sprint #5*, as the students will need this information to prepare accordingly. 

2. Is it appropriate to show all of the work we have completed or is some of it confidential? Please discuss this with your mentor

3. What are my expectations for student participation? Do all students need to speak? All students must have some role in the Fall Presentation.

After you answer these questions, you can start preparing your team. You will need to determine:

* Content
* Slide Preparation
    ** Tips and Common Feedback
* Speaking Roles
* Timeline

== Content

To create an outline for your presentation, we will be using the transformation matrix and data storytelling. Students will have completed these assignments on their own in Professional development #4, before you do this activity as a team in lab. 

*Transformation matrix:* 
The transformation matrix will help your team understand what your objectives for this presentation are and then create an outline for your presentation based on that. 

Students will fill out the contents of the matrix in Professional Development #4. It is a good idea for TA's to look at what they wrote before the in lab activity. 

The team will fill the transformation out together in the second lab of Sprint #5. Please watch this video for more information link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU&t=189s[Transformation Matrix]

Please use this table when completing this exercise in lab.

1. You will begin by filling out what your audience knows, believes (what they think), feels (an emotion) and does about the contents of your presentation. 

2. Then, you will fill out the "After" column, but in the reverse order. What you want your audience to do, feel, believe and know after your presentation?

3. Lastly, you want to fill in the center column - the Transformation Column. This column will be what you can *say, do* or *show* in your presentation to get the audience members to where you want them to be. In lab, you can use sticky notes or bullet points to fill out the center column. Each box can have multiple ideas that help transform the audience to where you want them after.

The ideas in the transformation column will make up the contents of your presentation. You can use them as an outline for your slides. 



[frame=all, cols = "4,4,4,4"]
|===
What they... | Before |-> | After

|*Know*
|  
|
|

|*Believe*
|
|
|

|*Feel*
|
|
|

|*Do*
|
|
|
|===

*Data Storytelling:* 

In addition to the outline provided by the transformation matrix, we want to create presentations that tell a story. This will make your presentations more engaging for your audience. 

In Professional Development #4, students filled out what their projects set up, conflict and resolution is. TA's please watch this short video for more information link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_34YnCmMY[Data Storytelling]. Again, it is a good idea to look at what students wrote for this before the in lab activity.  

After creating the transformation matrix, as a team talk through how you will tell a story with your data. Try to integrate these concepts into your outline provided by the transformation matrix. Answer the following questions together in lab. 

1. What is the setup of your projects story? What is the before state of the data? 

2. What is the conflict within your projects story? How is your data changing? Why?

3. What is the resolution within your project? What is the after state the change has lead to?

== Slide Preparation
After your team determines the relevant content for the presentation, you will need to put it in a shareable format. Many teams use sharepoint presentations. 

==== Tips and Common Feedback
* Make sure you meet the minimum requirements for content 
* Leave time for a Q&A, you do not have to fill the full 50 minutes with presentation.
* Make the presentation unique.
* Have *minimal words on the slides*. Use powerful visuals instead and verbally share accomplishments.
* As one of the last steps, make sure the presentation is uniform (same fonts and sizes, colors, styles).

View past presentations (from Spring Symposium) on link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/partnerships/corporate/?order=ASC&orderby=title&paged=1&custom_post_type=tribe_events,post&category=2025[The Data Mine Website] to get ideas.

=== Speaking Roles
Now that you have a presentation, you should communicate it to your audience. 
One of the best ways to do this is to identify the number of sections and then assign speakers based on comfortability. 
It is recommended to have a back-up speaker for each section. 

The most important part of assigning speaking roles for the Final Fall Presentation is making sure everyone has access to it.  


=== Timeline
Each team may require a slightly different timeline. Below is a generalized timeline of when to start and checkpoints along the way. 

11/05-11/19: Start your presentation. In lab, complete the transformation matrix and use it to outline for your slides. Integrate concepts from data storytelling.
