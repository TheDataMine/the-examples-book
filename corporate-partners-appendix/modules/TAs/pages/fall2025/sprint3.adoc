[[professional-development]]
=== &#10003; Grade Professional Development #2

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET.**

[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003; Grade Sprint Report #2 .
The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. It is divided into two sections: Self-Evaluation and Reflection.

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.
- **Implementation Check** shows how students put into practice the tasks connected to Professional Development.
- **Reflection** shows how students are connecting their experiences to project practices and the program.

**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team.

Due: on **Gradescope by Weddnesday, October 8, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET**

[[complete-team-report]]
=== &#10003; Complete Team Report #2

This report captures your responsibilities as a TA (Scrum Master) and your team’s progress in Sprint 2. It helps you reflect on what has been completed, what still needs attention, and what’s next.

Due: on **Gradescope by Weddnesday, October 8, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET**


[[doc]]
=== &#10003; Documentation in Project

As the TA (Scrum Master), your role is to guide students so they understand mentor needs and establish a documentation process the team can maintain consistently.  

* **During Mentor Meeting #1:** Facilitate the conversation so mentors explain what information they want documented. 

* **During Lab #1:** Guide the team in drafting a **collaborative documentation requirements format**. 

* **Submission:**: Upload the completed Documentation Framework to **Gradescope by Friday, October 12, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET**.
