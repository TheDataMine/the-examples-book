[[professional-development]]
=== &#10003; Grade Professional Development #2 

Please grade the Professional Development #2 assignment on Gradescope. As you review, pay close attention to Psychological Safety Point 2: Applying the Team Contract, and note during mentor meetings or labs whether students have started implementing the norm they chose to practice.

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET.**

[[sprint-report]]
=== &#10003; Grade Sprint Report #2 .
The Sprint Report serves both as part of the course grading requirements and as a way to give you insight into where each team member stands in their work and how they are thinking about the project. It is divided into three sections: Self-Evaluation, Implementation Check and Reflection.

- **Self-Evaluation** highlights how students view their presence, contributions, and collaboration.
- **Implementation Check** shows how students put into practice the tasks connected to Professional Development.
- **Reflection** shows how students are connecting their experiences to project practices and the program.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
**Grading**: Evaluate reports objectively based on the rubric, the evidence students provide, your observations from sessions, and the required number of sentences. Fair grading ensures accountability and consistency across the team and program.

[[complete-team-report]]
=== &#10003; Complete Team Report #2

This report captures your responsibilities as a TA (Scrum Master) and your team’s progress in Sprint 2. It helps you reflect on what has been completed, what still needs attention, and what’s next. It also provides your liaison with the context they need to offer support. Please complete this report after grading Sprint Report #2 submissions.

Due: on **Gradescope by Wednesday, October 8, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET**


[[doc]]
=== &#10003; Documentation in Project

Documentation is an ongoing practice that helps teams capture progress, decisions, and expectations in a way that mentors and stakeholders can easily follow. As the TA (Scrum Master), your role is to guide students so they understand mentor needs and establish a documentation process the team can maintain consistently.  


* **During Lab #1:** Facilitate team activity to draft a collaborative documentation framework based on the project charter – documentation section. Use the charter as a starting point, and note any unclear or missing details to bring up with mentors.

** What will be documented
** Where it will be stored (e.g., Team channel)
** How often it will be updated (daily, weekly, or per sprint)
** Who is responsible for updates

+
*Note:*  Confirm that documentation will be maintained as a shared responsibility, with all members contributing to the same collaborative document on a regular schedule. The draft should be discussed and clarified with mentors in the  following meeting.
 
* **During Mentor Meeting #2:** Build on the lab work by facilitating a conversation with mentors to clarify and finalize what information should be documented, the level of detail, and how often updates are expected.

Due: on **Gradescope by Friday, October 12, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET**.
