= Mid Semester Evaluation

Each semester, TAs are required to perform mid-semester evaluations in collaboration with their Corporate Partner Mentors. 

TAs should schedule a meeting with their mentors and jointly give feedback and grades to each student on the team.

== Gradescope and Feedback

Mid-semester feedback and grades are appointed through Gradescope. The same platform TAs use to grade sprint summary reports. 

Grading is broken into three categories:app-name: Attendance, Engagement & Participation, and Deliverables. 

The following pictures show how to evaluate students.

Lastly, there is also a text box to give personalized feedback to students. Both mentors and TAs are encouraged to give individualized feedback to the students.
