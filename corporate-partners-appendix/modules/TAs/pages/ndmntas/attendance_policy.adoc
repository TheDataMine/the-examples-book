= NDMN Attendance Policy

NDMN students are expected to be present for every Corporate Partner Meeting as they are receiving a monthly stipend from the NSF to participate.  Attendance is reported to the NSF to ensure students are meeting the requirements outlined in the program.  Multiple absences (excused or unexcused) will be reported to and reviewed by The Data Mine team to determine if the student can remain in the program. 


For the purposes of this course, being “present” means attending all online meetings with camera on and actively participating. 


The following are types of absences that will be considered excused:

• Grief/Bereavement 
• Jury Duty
• Medical Excused Absence or Emergent Medical Care 
• Military Absence 
• Parenting Leave 

NOTE:  If you are feeling ill, please email/message your TA immediately. They do not need details about your symptoms; simply let them know you are feeling ill and cannot come to your meeting. 

*Regardless if your absence is planned or unplanned, excused or unexcused, please notify your TA as soon as possible and work with them to catch up on missed information and work.*

== Three-Strike Attendance Policy
 
== Introduction
 
Maintaining consistent attendance is crucial for the success of our program and the academic progress of our students. To ensure commitment and accountability, we have implemented a *three-strike attendance policy*. This guide outlines the details of the policy, the consequences of accumulating strikes, and the steps students can take to avoid strikes.
 
== Policy Overview
 
The *three-strike policy* is designed to encourage regular attendance and active participation in the program. Each unexcused absence counts as a strike. *After three strikes, a student may be dismissed from the program*.
 
=== Unexcused Absences
 
An absence is considered unexcused if it does not meet the criteria for an excused absence and is not reported according to the program's attendance reporting procedures.
 
*Examples of unexcused absences:*
- Missing a session without prior notice or a valid reason.
- Failing to provide appropriate documentation for an absence.
 
=== Excused Absences
 
An absence may be excused if it is due to valid reasons and properly reported.
 
*Examples of excused absences:*
- Medical appointments (with a doctor's note).
- Family emergencies.
- Academic obligations (with prior approval).
 
== Reporting Absences
 
To report an absence:
1. Notify your TA as soon as possible.
2. Provide appropriate documentation to your TA for the absence.
3. Follow up to ensure the absence is recorded as excused.
 
== Strike Consequences
 
=== First Strike
 
Upon receiving the first strike:
- The student will receive a warning notification.
- The CRP TA will discuss the attendance policy with the student to prevent further strikes.
 
=== Second Strike
 
Upon receiving the second strike:
- The student will receive a second warning notification.
- The student will meet with the Head TA and their CRP TA to discuss the reasons for the absences and develop a plan for improvement so that a third strike does not occur
 
=== Third Strike
 
Upon receiving the third strike:
- The student will receive a final notification.
- The Head TA and Program Coordinator will review the student's attendance record and make a decision regarding dismissal from the program.
- The student may be dismissed from the program based on the review.
 
== Avoiding Strikes
 
*Tips for avoiding strikes:*
- Plan and prioritize your schedule to avoid conflicts with program sessions.
- Communicate proactively with the TA and follow their advice if you anticipate an absence.
- Provide required documentation promptly for any excused absences.
- Seek support if you are facing challenges that impact your attendance.
 
== Conclusion
 
The three-strike attendance policy is in place to ensure commitment and active participation in our program. By understanding and adhering to this policy, students can contribute to a productive and successful learning environment. If you have any questions or concerns about the policy, please contact the TA.

==== Dropped Absences 

NEW: Students will get to drop one missed LAB (1 hr 50 min) and one missed LEC (50 min) per semester. The missed class will still show up on your sprint report when graded by your TA, but The Data Mine staff will add in the drops at the end of the semester.

==== Unexcused Absences
What if the absence does not meet the criteria of one of the excused absence types above?

Absences outside of those excused class absences are at the discretion of the TA and Mentor. Students should work with their TA directly to discuss their absence and the opportunity to complete missed coursework. Should there be any concerns, please email: datamine@purdue.edu
