= Responsibility Overview

== Introduction
This document outlines the responsibilities and expectations for TAs in the Purdue National Data Mine virtual environment. It serves as a guide to navigate common challenges and maintain effective communication, project management, and collaboration.

Being a fully online TA in the National Data Mine is different from being a TA on campus at Purdue.

This guide aims to equip TAs with the best practices and strategies to thrive in this virtual environment.

- Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from team members about their experience and any challenges they face.


=== Documentation
- Keep detailed meeting notes and share them with the team.
- Document all processes and decisions for transparency and future reference.

== Collaboration and Team Building
=== Virtual Team-Building Activities
- Plan virtual team-building activities to foster a sense of community.
- Examples include virtual coffee breaks, online games, or icebreaker sessions.
