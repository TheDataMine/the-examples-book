= Agile Methodology Overview

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that promotes flexible responses to change. In The Data Mine, each semester consists of 7 two-week sprints.

- *Sprint Planning:* Work with your team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.
- *Daily Stand-ups:* Facilitate short meetings to discuss progress, plan for the day, and identify any blockers.
- *Sprint Review:* Review the work completed and the planned work that has not been completed.
- *Sprint Retrospective:* Identify and discuss what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how to improve.
