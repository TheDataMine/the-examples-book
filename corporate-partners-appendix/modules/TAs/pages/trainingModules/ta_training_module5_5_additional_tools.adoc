== Repository Set Up
If your team is interested in using a repository, please send a ticket to datamine-help@purdue.edu and Data Mine staff will set up a repository for you. Data Mine staff will set up the repository for you team and will provide your team access. 

It is also fine for your company to set up their own repository.

Why?

* This makes it easier to transition on-going projects between years. 
* Data Mine hosting will ensure confidentiality is protected. If students host their own repositories, this can cause issues. 

If you have more questions about setting up a repository, please let Data Mine Staff know.
