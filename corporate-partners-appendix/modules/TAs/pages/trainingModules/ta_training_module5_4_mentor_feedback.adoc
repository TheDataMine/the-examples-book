[[feedback-overview]]
== Feedback Overview

As a TA, you will work with mentors to provide **individualized feedback** to each student **twice per semester** — once at the midpoint and again at the end of the semester.  

TAs and mentors should collaborate closely when completing feedback. Schedule a meeting to review observations together and finalize rubric ratings and written comments directly in **Gradescope**.  
Only the TA has access to Gradescope, so during the meeting, they should **share their screen** while entering feedback.  

_See the semester schedule for due dates._

**Feedback Process:** +
**Reflection → Evaluation → Feedback**  +
Students reflect on their progress → TAs and mentors evaluate using the rubric → Feedback is written to recognize growth and guide improvement.


---

[[before-meeting]]
== Before the Feedback Meeting  

Students complete reflection prompts in their **Sprint Reports** — Sprint #3 for the **Mid-Semester Checkpoint** and Sprint #6 for the **End-of-Semester Feedback**.  
These responses highlight what they’re most proud of, teamwork experiences, and areas for growth.  

Before your feedback meeting: 

* Review each student’s reflection to understand their perspective and contributions.  
* Note specific examples or patterns that might guide your discussion.  
* Keep all reflections confidential — they are for internal use only between you and the mentor.  

You may reference key points from a student’s reflection during your discussion to provide context for evaluating their engagement or progress.  

---

[[during-meeting]]
== During the Feedback Meeting  

During your meeting, open **Gradescope** and review each rubric category with your mentor.  
The same rubric will be used for both mid-semester and end-of-semester feedback.  

For each student:  

1. Reference the student’s reflection to understand their perspective.  
2. Discuss attendance, participation, and deliverables.  
3. Select the rubric level that best represents performance.  
4. Write a short, personalized comment in the *Comments* section.  

Use the reflection as a conversation starter — it helps connect the student’s self-assessment with your shared observations.  
Acknowledge growth or challenges mentioned by the student when appropriate.  

**Remember:** The purpose of this process is to provide *constructive, balanced feedback* that recognizes student progress and guides improvement.  
Once you and your mentor are aligned on each category, proceed to the rubric section below to record your evaluations in Gradescope.  

---

[[rubric]]
=== Using the Rubric  

The rubric provides a shared framework for evaluating students consistently across teams and semesters.  
It includes three graded categories — *Attendance*, *Participation & Engagement*, and *Deliverables* — as well as several ungraded leadership competencies.  

When applying the rubric:  
* Use clear examples from meetings, communications, and deliverables.  
* Align your ratings with the rubric descriptions.  
* Reference the student’s reflection for additional context.  

_See the rubric below for detailed category descriptions._

[[rubric-table]]
==== Rubric Table 

////
Mentor and TA feedback is provided twice a semester: after 8 weeks and at the end of the semester. TAs and Mentors should collaborate on the feedback for each student on the team. We recommend the TA and Mentor schedule a meeting to discuss and put the feedback into Gradescope. Only the TA has access to Gradescope, but they should share their screen on the call with the Mentor.

*See semester schedule for due dates.*

[[writing-feedback]]
=== Writing Personalized Feedback  

After completing the rubric, write a **short, individualized comment** in the *Comments* section in Gradescope.  
This feedback helps students understand **why** they received a rating and **how** they can continue improving.  

When writing feedback:  

* Reference the rubric level selected.  
* Include 1–2 specific examples or observations.  
* Highlight one strength and one growth area.  
* Keep comments concise (3–4 sentences per student).  

> Example:  
> "You consistently completed your assigned tasks on time and contributed thoughtful ideas during team discussions. Both your TA and mentors appreciate your reliability and the positive energy you bring to meetings. Moving forward, we encourage you to take initiative in leading a portion of a team presentation or discussion to strengthen your leadership and communication skills. We appreciate your consistency and encourage you to continue challenging yourself in new ways."

==== Tips for Constructive Feedback

* Use examples and observations — avoid assumptions.  
* Focus on areas the student can control and improve.  
* Pair observations with specific recommendations.  
* Keep a balanced, encouraging tone.  
* Watch this 5-minute TED talk titled link:https://www.ted.com/talks/leeann_renninger_the_secret_to_giving_great_feedback?language=en["The secret to giving great feedback"]

==== Examples  

|===  
| **Less Helpful** | **More Constructive**  

| “You need to do better.” | “You met deadlines — adding more detail to your updates will help the team stay informed.”  
| “You need to talk more.” | “You’re often quiet, but your ideas are valuable. Try sharing one thought per meeting to build confidence.”

== How to Provide Constructive Feedback

=== Tips 

* Use examples and observations in your feedback. Do not make assumptions. 
* Focus your feedback on areas the student can control and improve on (as opposed to identifying problems out of the student's control).
* Share recommendations and solutions for the problem you identify.
* Watch this 5-minute TED talk titled link:https://www.ted.com/talks/leeann_renninger_the_secret_to_giving_great_feedback?language=en["The secret to giving great feedback"]

=== Examples of Bad Constructive Feedback

* "You need to do better."
* "You need to talk more."


=== Examples of Good Constructive Feedback

* "You are reserved during team meetings, but we would value your insights. We encourage you to unmute and share your ideas more often. "
