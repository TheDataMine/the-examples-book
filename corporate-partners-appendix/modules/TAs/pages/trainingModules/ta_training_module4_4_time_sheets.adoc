= Time Sheets

TAs are required to track their weekly hours using a time sheet provided by The Data Mine. The time sheets are meant to be used as a record for all of the responsibilities fulfilled as a TA and should be updated regularly throughout the week. 

At the end of every week, TAs should total their hours and submit hours at Purdue's human capital management tool, SuccessFactors. The link to access SuccessFactors is https://one.purdue.edu/launch-task/all/successfactors-employee?roles=.
