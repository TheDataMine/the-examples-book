= Time Sheets

At the end of every week, TAs should submit hours at Purdue's human capital management tool, SuccessFactors. The link to access SuccessFactors is https://one.purdue.edu/launch-task/all/successfactors-employee?roles=. 

*TAs can submit up to 10 hours a week. If 10 hours is not sufficient to complete your TA responsibilities, you may talk with The Data Mine staff. International students can only have 20 hours of paid work across all jobs.*
