= TA Training Module 1: Exploring The Data Mine

== An Innovative, Immersive Living Learning Community
The sheer number of personal technology devices has led to an explosion in the amount of raw data produced in society. Twenty billion devices are now connected to the internet; it is estimated that by 2030, that number will rise to 1 trillion. All of these devices are constantly producing data.

Data scientists are the critical link that transform this data into information that can be applied to solve real-world problems. The study of this data affects everyone and is needed in every sector. Data science solutions are applied to everything from preventive maintenance in manufacturing to food science initiatives that address food insecurity.

The Data Mine is a living, learning and research-based community created to introduce students to data science concepts and equip them to create solutions to real-world problems. Members of The Data Mine will be part of a team, living, studying and ultimately, performing data-driven research together. The Data Mine is part of Purdue University’s Integrative Data Science Initiative, which is designed to train students across all majors with the data literacy needed to succeed in a data-driven world.

The Data Mine experience allows students the opportunity to live and learn in a community that revolves around a particular topic or theme. The topics and themes studied within The Data Mine incorporate components relevant to any field of study. Students in each community may live in a residence hall (not required), where they will have access to renovated study space, upgraded learning technology and hands-on interaction with faculty within the hall. Fall 2025 TDM Residence Halls include Hillenbrand and McCutcheon.

The Data Mine is open to students from any major of study. Students will learn some of the skills most sought after by companies and graduate programs. No computational background is required. The key trait for joining The Data Mine is the desire to learn data science in a rigorous, but welcoming environment.

== Living and Learning
The National Science Foundation awarded Purdue University with $1.5 million, to implement the Statistics Living Learning Community (STAT-LLC) from 2014 to 2019 in Hillenbrand Hall.

We have come a long way since our first flyer was posted in 2013, announcing the application process for students for the STAT-LLC.

Hillenbrand was selected as the University Residence of the Year for 2016-17.

Our students in the STAT-LLC published papers and delivered talks at conferences more than 150 times during the 2014-19 life of our NSF grant.

In 2018-19, we scaled this effort up, by introducing The Data Mine to approximately 100 students on campus. In 2019-20, we scaled it up again, to more than 600 students. We continue to grow with just 1000 students in 2021-22, 1300+ students in 2022-23, 1700+ students in 2023-24 including students from over 40 universities.

Due to the growing success of The Data Mine, we have outgrown our space in Hillenbrand. We are excited to announce a new building is coming in 2026 as another place for The Data Mine students to live! Until then, we have student in Hillenbrand and McCutcheon Halls for the 2025-26 school year. The supportive faculty and staff members who work in these halls are also crucial to the success of this student-centered initiative.

The Data Mine is structured into several learning communities that allow for student connection and interaction. The students participate in courses, seminars, research, and professional development experiences, which are offered by departments, research centers, and colleges throughout the university.

In addition, roughly 600 students participate in The Data Mine’s Corporate Partners program, which enables the students to work directly with employees of companies or national laboratories on data-driven projects.

== What all students have in common
- All have the desire to learn data science in a rigorous, but welcoming environment.
- All take a 1-credit hour seminar (TDM 101000) one day a week to learn new skills.
- A growing number of students are in TDM 201000, TDM 301000, and TDM 401000. These are students in their second, third, and fourth year in The Data Mine.
- The Data Mine is open to students from any major of study. No computational background is required.
- All students are valued and have potential to do great things! This is a strength of this learning community.
- Many may be nervous, and our job is to teach and encourage them.
- There are 1800+ students in The Data Mine this year!

== Seminar Courses: TDM 10100, 20100, 30100, 40100, 50100
Each Monday Seminar sections meet in the Hillenbrand dining hall atrium at the following times -
•	8:30-9:30 AM
•	9:30-10:30 AM
•	10:30 -11:30 AM
•	4:30-5:30 PM (Virtual)
•	Asynchronous online

Students work on weekly projects (usually using R, Python, SQL, or UNIX) consisting of 4-5 questions.

TAs help students while they work in seminars, during office hours or through the Piazza online discussion board.

== The National Data Mine Network
The National Data Mine Network (NDMN) is a collaborative project between The Purdue Data Mine and the American Statistical Association that will enable undergraduate students at network institutions to learn fundamental and advanced data science. These undergraduates will engage with industry partners and Purdue researchers on academic-year long data science projects. 

National Data Mine students joining Purdue courses are expected to attend all required course times and complete all course work.

See xref:trainingModules/ta_training_module4_2_environment.adoc[Creating a Welcoming Environment] to better learn how to collaborate with virtual students. Please direct any other questions about NDMN to your head TA.

== The Indiana Data Mine
The Indiana Data Mine is another extension of The Data Mine to colleges and universities specifically within Indiana. Funded by a **$10 Million Grant from the Lilly Foundation**.  The Indiana Data Mine will give access to fundamental data science education and unique engagement opportunities with researchers and corporate partners. A primary goal of the Indiana Data Mine is to strengthen the already growing tech sector of Indiana. 

Indiana Data Mine students joining Purdue courses are expected to attend all required course times and complete all course work.

See xref:trainingModules/ta_training_module4_2_environment.adoc[Creating a Welcoming Environment] to better learn how to collaborate with virtual students. Please direct any other questions about IDM to your head TA.
