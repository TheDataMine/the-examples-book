= TA Training Module 5: Weekly Rhythms 

In this section we will review the TA policies to follow while acting as a TA and working under The Data Mine model. These tasks will repeat throughout the semester and by following a steady sprint schedule, your team will find a consistent and continuous approach to the project.

Please work through the sub modules under this module.
