= Semester Check-Ins

== Why We Do Check-Ins

Check-ins are designed to strengthen communication, trust, and understanding within your team.
They give every student a chance to share their progress, challenges, and ideas in a private, supportive space — and help TAs recognize how to better guide and motivate each individual.

Regular 1-on-1 conversations also promote **psychological safety**, making it easier for students to raise concerns and for TAs to proactively address issues before they grow.
Over time, this practice improves overall **team productivity, collaboration, and engagement.**

== How Check-Ins Work

Every five weeks, TAs host brief *1-on-1 check-ins* with each team member.

* For *in-person teams*: hold check-ins *during lab* when possible.
* For *online teams*: hold check-ins *via Teams with cameras on*.

Regardless of format, each student should have a dedicated conversation focused on *progress, experience, and goals*.
TAs are encouraged to schedule *additional check-ins* whenever it benefits the team or helps address emerging issues.
