Some ideas for meeting warmups include:

- Kahoot
- Would you rathers
- Purdue themed questions
- Charty party

== Working with Virtual students

The Data Mine is expanding! We now collaborate with universities across the United States including California, New Mexico, Texas, Ohio, and more. Students join various Data Mine cohorts. We want the National Data Mine Network (NDMN), Indiana Data Mine (IDM), and other national students joining Corporate Partners to feel welcome and collaborate with the team. How do you, as a TA, best support students joining virtually? Below are a few tips from TAs who have worked with hybrid teams. 

* Offer online warm-ups so everyone can participate. 
* Partner online students with in-person students. This will allow students to form a connection and better communicate.
* During discussions in lab, provide opportunities for online students to speak up and join the conversation. Students may find it difficult to add to the conversation. 
* Assign work to your online students, continue holding high expectations, and continue with fluid communication to all students. Check in with students who are online.
