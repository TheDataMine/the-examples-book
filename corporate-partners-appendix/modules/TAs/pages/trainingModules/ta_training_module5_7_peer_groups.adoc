= Peer Mentor Groups

All TAs will be placed in peer mentor groups for the academic year. These groups are meant as a support system for new and continuing TDM TAs. 

Each group will have at least one experienced TA that will be well suited to answer any questions on the TA experience including best practices, weekly rhythms, and more. 

Teams are encouraged to meet in person once every month to connect and engage with their fellow TAs. Each peer mentor group will be added to a private MS teams channel where they can freely ask questions. 

For more support, TAs can email the datamine-help@purdue.edu or stop by a team member's office in MRGN.
