= Peer Mentor Groups

All TAs will be placed in peer mentor groups for the academic year. These groups are meant as a support system for new and continuing CRP TAs. 

Most groups will have at least one experienced TA that will be well suited to answer any questions on the TA experience including best practices, weekly rhythms, and more. 

Teams are encouraged to meet in person once each sprint to connect and engage with their fellow TAs. You will be asked on your Team Report what you did with your peer group. Each peer mentor group should also create a private MS teams channel where they can freely ask questions. 

For more support, TAs can email the datamine-help@purdue.edu or stop by a team member's office in MRGN.
