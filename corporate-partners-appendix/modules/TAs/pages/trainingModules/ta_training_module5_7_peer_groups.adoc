= Peer Mentor Groups

== Overview

All TAs will be placed in peer mentor groups for the academic year. These groups are meant as a support system for new and continuing TDM TAs. 

Each group will have at least one experienced TA that will be well suited to answer any questions on the TA experience including best practices, weekly rhythms, and more. 

For more support, TAs can email the datamine-help@purdue.edu or stop by a team member's office in MRGN. 

== Requirements

- Teams are required to meet (in person or virtually) once every sprint to connect and engage with their peer group
- Each Team Report that TAs submit will have a question asking about their interactions with their peer groups

== Best Practices

- Share your best practices for team engagement and bonding 
- Developing lab or meeting content (if applicable)
- Study sessions
