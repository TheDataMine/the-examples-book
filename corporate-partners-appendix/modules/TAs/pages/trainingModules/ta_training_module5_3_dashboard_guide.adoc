== Microsoft Teams Task Planner

Using MS Teams Task Planner is _STRONGLY_ recommended as our teams are hosted on MS Teams. Follow the steps below to set up your teams planner.

Start by opening your teams application and logging in. This demonstration assumes you are already assigned a team. 

First, open the task planner by navigating to the three dots on the left panel of the screen. Then select the Task Planner application.

From the home dashboard you can create a list and add it to your team and preferred channel. Choosing this location will help your team stay organized, especially if you have sub-teams. If you are not sure where to add the list, it is common to add it to the 'general' channel.

Below, you will see a basic example of a dashboard with some items. Your team's will be more specific and full.

The next important view is the board. In the board view, there is the ability to add buckets, columns, to help track progress of tasks. This is especially helpful for a team working in Agile. An example of a board with Agile buckets is below.
