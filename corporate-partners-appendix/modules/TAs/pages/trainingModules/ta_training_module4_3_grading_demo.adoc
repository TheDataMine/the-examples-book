Greatest takeaways following the video:

1. Students must earn their grades.
2. If you are not sure, ask. Data Mine staff and the Head TA are happy to help. 
3. Do not change settings.
4. Meet your deadlines.

You will use the left hand column of drop down boxes to assign grades to each student. By selecting the box, it will automatically take off the number of points listed directly next to the box you selected. 

Do *not* ‘Add Rubric Item[s],’ ‘Create Group,’ or ‘Import’ into the assignment without permission from Maggie. This will change the grading rubric for all TAs as well as upgrade all reports already graded. Data Mine Staff will create the rubrics. 
If there is a specific comment you would like to leave on a student’s report you can add that in the text box located under ‘Submission Specific Adjustments.’

Above you can see two questions with the leading description ‘Did not adequately contribute to the [team].’ Contribution levels are up to the TA’s discretion based on the student’s contribution to the team during the sprint. The rest of the rubric is more direct. You will check the form type (pdf) submitted, check word counts are within the cut-offs listed in the question directions (100-200 or 200-400), and documentation checks. By following the rubric like a checklist, you will know what to look for in the student report.  

Below you will find examples similar to what student's have written. There is a poorly written report where the student did not *earn* a high grade, acceptable report, and a well written report.
