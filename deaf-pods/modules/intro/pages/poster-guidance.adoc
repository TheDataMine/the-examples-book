= Poster Deliverables

A poster presentation is a great way to organize and summarize your long-term project *visually*. A poster consists of a somewhat timeline of your project and provides a high-level overview of your project's accomplishments and challenges.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These posters will be shared *publicly*. It is essential that students work closely with their Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared without violating any NDAs. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting publicly. 
====

* _[Per Team]_ A poster template is uploaded to your general chat of your MS Teams group ("Files" tab). We encourage you to change the colors of your poster to match the branding requirements of your corporate partner.
** Subteams should work together to make one poster. 
** _It is imperative that you work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared._

== Expectations

* *All students must contribute to the poster but likely in different roles.*
* *Work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared*. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting publicly. 

== Due Dates

[TIP]
====
*Draft* of the poster due *Friday, April 21, 2023*. 

*Final version* of the poster due *Wednesday, May 3, 2023*.

====

A submitted *poster draft* should be at least 75% complete. Any sections without content/visuals should contain notes of what will be added. 

== Examples
The Data Mine had a virtual symposium in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Please note we had fewer Corporate Partner teams in 2020 & 2021.  It would be helpful to watch some of the videos and review the posters from link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2020.html[2019-2020], link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2021.html[2020-2021], and link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2022.html[2021-22].

== Create your poster

* Create your poster outline in PowerPoint and save it in the general channel of your MS Teams group. We encourage you to change the colors of your poster to match the branding requirements of your corporate partner.
* *Your poster should not be text heavy* -- it is not a paper, so complete sentences should be limited. Make sure to include multiple visuals and keep sentences to a minimum. Bullet points are encouraged.    
* Make sure to include all of these categories:

[cols="3,5"]

|*Introduction/Background/Motivation* |• We recommend looking back at the project description and materials shared during the first weeks of the fall semester. This will be a great resource to find introduction and background material and wording.
|*Research Methodology* |• The “how” of your research
|*Conclusions* |• What are your big picture findings? 
|*Future Goals* | • What are next steps if you had more time to continue? 
|*References & Acknowledgements* | • Thank your CRP Mentors, any faculty mentors, and others that helped on the project.

• Cite your sources! There may be too many to include, but list a few
*key* sources. 
|*Figures* | • Make sure to include relevant visuals
|*Layout & Design* | • Keep font and colors consistent.

• Make sure it is visually appealing. Zoom out and make the entire poster shows on your screen. What do you notice about it? Is it full of text? Too much white space? Not enough images? Flow is confusing?
