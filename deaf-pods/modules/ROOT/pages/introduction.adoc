## The Data Mine
https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine] is a data science focused experiential learning project here at Purdue University. We accept students of all undergraduate years and majors, and pair them with corporations. 

Using industry data, The Data Mine encourages collaborative learning amongst our students and to help devise solutions for whatever project or question the industry partner presents.

We intend to utilize this framework and build an experience that will enable a similar environment that allows Deaf students gain data science knowledge and tools to immerse deaf and hard of hearing students in a world of education, research, engagement, and 
collaboration.
