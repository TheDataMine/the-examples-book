=== Breakout: Schedule Discussion
In this breakout, you'll be discussing with your team to establish ~15 hours of collaborative meetings. You'll be actively meeting via Zoom or Teams to work and check in each other regarding this project.

Submission: We need a schedule of 15 hours (specific times) of live collaborative meetings from each group. We will use those schedules to randomly join and check in.
