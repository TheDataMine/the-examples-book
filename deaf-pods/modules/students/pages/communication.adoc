= Communication Guideline

== Working with Your Corporate Partner TA
Your Corporate Partner TA is the first person you should ask in most cases. They are your go-to resource for questions specific to your project/team.

* Ask for help when you do not understand. 
* Be in constant contact.
* Be direct about what you need.

== Working with Your Teammates
* Communicate with your team about your share of the work.
* Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Some of the projects focus on complicated topics and the teams are learning together. There are no bad questions in this type of environment!
* Be willing to “speak up” if problems arise. Your Corporate Partner TA and The Data Mine staff are here to support you, but you have to communicate with us when you need help. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to bring issues to our attention or say you don’t understand a concept. The earlier that you let us know, the easier we can help you.
* It is not ok to stop participating if the content gets difficult. Even if other students are more experienced, everyone should 1) make an effort to learn and get caught up and 2) find some way to contribute while trying to build up the necessary technical skills. Your Corporate Partner Mentor and TA can provide suggestions of other resources to help learn content. Again, you have to “speak up” when you need help!
* Deadlines are an unavoidable part of being a professional, and this program is no exception. Program requirements must be completed and submitted on or before the specified due date and delivery time deadline. Late work will not be accepted. Due dates and delivery time deadlines are defined as Eastern Time (as used in West Lafayette, Indiana).

== Working with The Data Mine (TDM) Staff
* Reach out for help early.
* Check in with staff and data scientists, they want to help you succeed.
* Poor planning does not constitute an emergency on TDM staff.
* Email The Data Mine shared email at datamine-help@purdue.edu.

== Working with Your Mentor
* Show up to meetings prepared to take notes and ask questions.
* Ask questions, especially if you do not understand something.
* Do not rely on your mentor to lead meetings. This is YOUR job.
