= Summer Program Wrap Up

On June 1 and June 2, everyone came into one same meeting room for student orientation. Then everyone was broken into smaller groups. +
As we came into one large group, we should end this program as one group again. +


== July 28: Team to Team Presentation
I have received some requests to interact with students from other projects. Some curiosity about how other projects are going. +
So, we decided to schedule times for each team to present their project work to other students and allow for interaction. Students are required to attend. +

Each team will have 20 minutes to present their work and then 10 minutes for Q&A.

== July 31: Chat with Dr. Stephanie Cawthon

As this program being grant-funded, we are required to have evaluation. Dr. Stephanie Cawthon is our 3rd party program assessor, and you can visit her https://www.stephaniecawthon.com/[page here to learn more about her background]. She's the one who created all surveys you received, and we [Purdue University] have no access to any data collected from this program.

Dr. Cawthon requested to have focus groups where she can talk with all of you to get better undersatnding of how this program is doing and what improvements need to be made. All data and infromation collected during this meeting is confidential.

Dr. Cawthon will remove any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from data before she shares results with us, meaning we will receive feedback with no information where/whom it comes from. 

Students are randomly selected to be assigned to a group (beside students who have pre-exisiting time conflicts).
