= Data Science Link Library

In an area as fast moving as data science there are always more topics than time. Due to this, if we can't provide direct expertise we want to provide resources. 

The data science link library is designed to be a repository of helpful links for topics of interest. 

We also welcome user input! If you have links that you've found helpful please add them.
