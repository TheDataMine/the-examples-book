== Introduction
Data visualization refers to the graphical representation of information and data. It helps to understand, analyze and communicate complex data in a clear and effective manner. Some popular tools for data visualization include:

* Matplotlib: a plotting library for the Python programming language.
* ggplot2: a data visualization package for the R programming language.
* D3.js: a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
* Tableau: a commercial data visualization and business intelligence software.
* Power BI: a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface easy to use for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

== Categories in Data Visualization

=== Relationships
* Scatterplot: Demonstrate the relationship between two variables, independent variable x, and dependent variable y.
* Bubble Chart: Demonstrate the relationship between three variables, x, y, and bubble size.

=== Comparisons
*	Bar Chart: Used for comparing two different variables.
*	Line Chart: For comparing the median and average values over some independent variable. Comparisons are also used for showing the trend of the data.

=== Distributions
*	Histogram: To showcase the distribution of the data, to know the mean and standard deviation of the data.
*	Box Plot: Used to show the maximum, minimum value, median, and lower quartile and upper quartile. And it depicts outliers in the plot too.

=== Compositions
*	Pie Chart: Composition of different categories in a 'pie'.
*	Stacked Bar Chart: Stack different compositions in a bar chart.
*	Stacked Area Chart: Stack different compositions in an area fashion.

== Process of data visualization
* Acquiring data: collecting data from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or APIs.
* Cleaning and transforming data: preparing the data for visualization by cleaning, transforming and aggregating it.
* Choosing the right type of visualization: selecting the best visualization technique based on the type and nature of data.
* Creating the visualization: using tools and software to create the actual visualization.
* Interpreting the visualization: analyzing the visualization to derive insights and draw conclusions.

== Misinterpreting of data visualization
The following are common issues with different types of graphs. These do not represent all possible issues, but give an example of the different ways that people interpret information. 

. **Pie charts with unequal areas**: Pie charts can be misleading if the areas of the slices are not proportional to the data they represent. In a pie chart with unequal areas, the viewer may misinterpret the data, thinking that a larger area represents a larger value, even though that may not be the case. 
+
For example, if the chart shows results amounting to 100% based on the question `where would you be open to relocating?`, the pie chart could instantly become inaccurate because many respondents may have picked multiple locations.To avoid this kind of inaccuracy, using a Venn diagram would be a better choice.
. **Truncated Y-axis**: A truncated Y-axis can make differences when data appear larger or smaller than they really are. This type of misinformation occurs when the graphâ€™s producers ignore convention and manipulate the y-axis. The conventional way of organizing the y-axis is to start at 0 and then go up to the highest data point in your set. By not setting the origin of the y-axis at zero, small differences become hyperbolic and therefore plays an important role is midleading the viewers
. **Misleading scale**: There are a few different ways that a scale can be misleading in a data visualization. One common way is to use a non-linear scale. For example, a logarithmic scale is a non-linear scale that can be used to compress data that spans a wide range of values. While a logarithmic scale can be useful in certain situations, it can also be misleading if it is not appropriate for the data being presented. 
+
Suppose you have a chart that shows the number of COVID-19 cases in different countries. The chart uses a logarithmic scale on the Y-axis, which means that the distance between each tick mark on the Y-axis increases by a factor of 10. To avoid this type of misleading scale, it is important to choose a scale that is appropriate for the data being presented. A linear scale is often the most appropriate scale for data that covers a relatively small range of values, while a logarithmic scale can be useful for data that spans a wide range of values. It is also important to clearly label the scale on the chart so that the viewer can accurately interpret the data.
. **3D charts**: One of the main problems with 3D charts is that they can distort the perspective and make it difficult to accurately read and compare the data. For example, the use of shading and perspective can make some parts of the chart appear larger or smaller than they actually are. This can lead to misinterpretation of the data and incorrect conclusions being drawn. 
+
To avoid this type of misleading 3D chart, it is important to use a chart type that accurately represents the data being shown. For example, a simple 2D bar chart or a stacked bar chart may be more appropriate for showing the sales figures for different products in a market. If a 3D chart is necessary, it is important to use shading and perspective sparingly and to ensure that the data is accurately represented. Additionally, labeling the chart axes and data points clearly can help to reduce confusion and misinterpretation.
. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables. When two variables are correlated, changes in one variable are associated with changes in the other variable. However,correlation does not imply causation. In other words, just because two variables are correlated, it does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the other variable to change. 
+
For example, let's say that a study found a strong correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates. The study might conclude that as ice cream sales increase, so do crime rates. However, it would be incorrect to assume that ice cream sales cause crime rates to increase. Instead, there might be a third variable, such as temperature, that causes both ice cream sales and crime rates to increase. In this case, ice cream sales and crime rates are correlated, but ice cream sales do not cause crime rates to increase. 
+
Causation, on the other hand, refers to a direct relationship between two variables, where one variable is responsible for causing a change in the other variable. Establishing causation requires more evidence than just correlation. In order to establish causation, researchers need to use experimental methods that can demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between the two variables.For example, let's say that a study found that when people take a certain medication, their symptoms improve. In this case, there is evidence to suggest that the medication causes the improvement in symptoms. This is an example of causation.
. **Wrong Chart Type**: Using the wrong chart type is a common mistake in data visualization. Choosing the appropriate chart type for the data being presented is important because it can affect how the data is perceived and understood. Here are some examples of how using the wrong chart type can be misleading or confusing:
** Using a pie chart for too many categories: Pie charts are useful for displaying a small number of categories, but they can be difficult to read and interpret when there are too many categories. For example, a pie chart with 20 slices would be difficult to read, and the slices may be too small to accurately compare. A better alternative in this case would be a bar chart.
** **Using a line chart for categorical data**: Line charts are best used for showing trends over time or continuous data. If the data is categorical, such as types of products, a bar chart or a stacked bar chart would be more appropriate.
** **Using a scatter plot for non-linear data**: Scatter plots are useful for showing the relationship between two variables, but they assume a linear relationship. If the relationship between the variables is not linear, using a scatter plot can be misleading. A better alternative in this case would be a different type of chart, such as a bubble chart.
** **Using a stacked chart when the total is not meaningful**: Stacked charts are useful for showing the relative contribution of different categories to a total. However, if the total is not meaningful or cannot be easily determined,a stacked chart can be confusing. In this case, using a regular bar chart would be more appropriate.
** In summary, choosing the wrong chart type can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, and incorrect conclusions.
. **Cherry-picking**: Cherry-picking refers to selectively choosing which sets or sources of information to include in a survey, study, chart, or graph, in order to achieve a desired outcome that fits a particular trend, pattern, or narrative. This approach is often used to present a clear, easily interpretable picture of the data. However, the problem with cherry-picking is that it can result in inaccurate or incomplete information, and can misrepresent the true nature of the data. This lack of objectivity can be misleading and ultimately prevent a complete understanding of the information being presented.
