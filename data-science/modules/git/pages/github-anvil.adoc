= GitHub on Anvil

GitHub is automatically installed on Purdue's high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. 

However, you'll need to know some command line GitHub in order to make it work. 

Below is an example of setting up a repository on Anvil, making a change, and pushing the change to the repository. 

== Anvil Example

=== Connecting to Anvil
. Log-in to ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu with your ACCESS ID. 
** If this process isn't familiar to you, follow the instructions to xref:data-engineering:rcac:access-setup.adoc[sign up for Anvil].
. After logging in navigate to `The Data Mine` and select `Jupyter Notebook`. 
. You can use the defaults for the example. Select `Launch` to request your session.
. Once the session is running, select `Connect to Jupyter` to start. 
. In the Jupyter Lab session select the blue plus sign (+) in the upper-left corner to launch a new session. 
. In the launcher, scroll to the very bottom and under `Other` select `Terminal`.
** We'll use this terminal session in the setup steps next. 

=== Setting up a Repository
In this example we'll clone The Examples Book repository. However, the same code can be followed to setup your team's GitHub repository on Anvil. 

. In a browser, navigate to the website for the repository that you would like to clone. In this case: https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book. 
. Click the green `<> Code` button and select `SSH` and then copy the link.

====
If you haven't setup SSH keys you'll need to do that before the remaining steps will work. 

Follow the xref:data-engineering:rcac:anvil-windows-vm.adoc#ssh-key-configuration[SSH setup steps] to get it working.
