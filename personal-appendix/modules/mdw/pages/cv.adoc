== Current Position

I am a Professor of Statistics and (by courtesy) of Agricultural & Biological Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Public Health at Purdue University. My research is in probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic techniques for the analysis of algorithms and data structures.  I am also interested in data science, science of information, game theory, and large-scale computation. I currently serve as Director of https://datamine.purdue.edu[The Data Mine] and Interim Director of the Integrative Data Science Initiative.  I am also Associate Director of the Actuarial Science Program.
