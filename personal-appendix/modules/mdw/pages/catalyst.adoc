= Catalyst

In 1794, Elizabeth Fulhame introduced and analyzed the concept of catalysis, in her book _An Essay on Combustion, with a View to a New Art of Dying and Painting, wherein the Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Hypotheses are Proved Erroneous_.

.The Oxford English Dictionary provides an early description of the usage of the word *catalytic*, in 1836:
[quote,translation of J. J. Berzelius,Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal vol. 21 227]
"Many substances..possess the power of exercising upon compound bodies an influence essentially distinct from chemical affinity, an influence which consists in the production of a displacement, and a new arrangement of their elements, without their directly and necessarily participating in it... In defining it a new power..I shall designate it..the _catalytic power_ of bodies; and the decomposition it produces I shall call _catalysis_."

The Data Mine enables students to learn data science tools and methodologies at an early point in their career, before they enter the workforce.  They also learn domain-specific skills first-hand from their mentors in industry.  As a result, The Data Mine is a catalyst for change:  The students are making a significant impact even before they have graduated and joined the workforce.

== Prioritizing the Needs of Others

We owe our philosophy for The Data Mine's modus operandi to Dr. E. Daniel "Dan" Hirleman and Dr. David "Dave" McKinnis, and implemented at the earliest stages by Ms. Margaret "Maggie" Betz.  Dan had the early idea that companies might be willing to negotiate new contracts with Purdue University.  The companies would explain their most pressing data science needs to students, and the students would actively work to provides solutions to meet the companies' needs.  In this way, the companies would proactive accomplish cutting-edge work in the data sciences, and the students would enable the design of new algorithms, applications, environments, methodologies, and tools.  These partnerships would result in a tremendous return on investment for the companies, and would enable students to have a much deeper understand of the applications of data science in the workforce.  Dave provided brilliant guidance about the business model.  Essentially, paraphrasing his advice, he told encouraged us: "Never worry about the money: If the students have a great experience, and the companies have a great experience, the money will come naturally."  Wow, Dave was right!  Maggie developed these ideas into a mature, systematic model of engagement between students and their industry mentors.  As a result, The Data Mine has enabled numerous new and ongoing partnerships between universities and Corporate Partners all over the world.

== Origins

The first written description of The Data Mine, from a recruiting email draft on November 17, 2017, to Haley Cutler and Jonathan Manz:

"I am pleased to mention a new opportunity that might interest you.  We are starting a new Living-Learning Community for 2018-19 called "The Data Mine".  We have an inclusive approach that enables students from any data-driven discipline to make it "mine".  Indeed, students from any college on campus can apply.  Each student will participate in a 1 credit seminar for data-driven professional development, including a mix of training and guest speakers.  By learning and living with other students in Hillenbrand, we will foster a welcoming environment for all students who want to work in data-driven careers of all kinds.  We will also attempt (although we cannot guarantee) to find research experiences on campus for students who want to be involved in data-driven projects."

In fall 2018, The Data Mine seminar was launched.  It consisted of a 1-credit data science seminar, led by Mark Daniel Ward, and also a partnership with Viasat, in which one small team of students worked on a research project with Mark Rapo and Gideon Shalev.

Ellen Gundlach joined The Data Mine as Managing Director in May 2019, and The Data Mine launched a wide variety of academic learning communities for students at Purdue University.  Eric Zinn, in his role as Vice President for Student Corporate Experience Development at Purdue Research Foundation, helped to foster the concept of working with a handful of companies during academic year 2019-20.  Kevin Amstutz joined in October 2019 as Instruction Specialist.  In December 2019, Maggie Betz joined The Data Mine as Corporate Partners Senior Manager.

== State of The Data Mine

At the time of writing, The Data Mine has 24 employees, more than 1500 undergraduate and graduate students, and more than 80 partnerships with companies and universities... and we are still at the beginning.  In its sixth year of operation, The Data Mine is self-funded and brings millions of dollars of revenue to the university.
