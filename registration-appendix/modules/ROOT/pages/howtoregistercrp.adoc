== 2. Review the available projects 

Project descriptions for AY 2022-23 will be added on a *rolling basis* to this page: https://projects.the-examples-book.com/projects/

Remember to click on the project description title to view the PDF description for each project. See our <<howtoregistercrp-tips, tips for navigating and searching the projects page>>. 

== 3. Add a corporate partner project to your schedule 
_If you are admitted to Corporate Partners, follow these instructions_

We will continue to update our list of project descriptions on a rolling basis throughout the summer as we confirm projects with our Corporate Partners. *Please do not register for a project just for the sake of registering, as that will take up a spot from a student that may actually want to be on that particular project.* We will have a placeholder project set up for you to use if you are unsure and want to see what projects continue to roll in. We are expecting approximately 75 projects total this next academic year, so you will have plenty to choose from.


1. Read through the project descriptions available here https://projects.the-examples-book.com/projects/. Make sure to click on the description title to view the corresponding PDF file of details.


2. Click on the appropriate link below depending on if you need to register for TDM 11100/21100/31100/41100. This level is dependent on how many years you have been in Corporate Partners, not how many years you have been in The Data Mine (seminar). If this is your first year in The Data Mine Corporate Partners, you need to register for TDM 11100 DMCP.
