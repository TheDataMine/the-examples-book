= Technical Setup

When working on a Corporate Partners project at The Data Mine we utilize xref:starter-guides:data-science:data-engineering:rcac:index.adoc[RCAC] resources for high performance computing. 

If it's your first time working on a project the first step is to set up your xref:starter-guides:data-science:data-engineering:rcac:access-setup.adoc[ACCESS account]. Once your ACCESS account is created please send your account information to The Data Mine staff and we'll add you to our allocation. 

== Collaborating with the Data Science team

If you have any questions related to data science, data engineering, RCAC resources, or any other topics we are here to help! 

Please read through xref:crp:students:ds_team_support.adoc[Data Science Team support doc] for information on how to request help.
