= Data Modeling

== Introduction

This section of the Starter Guides is dedicated towards general data modeling background knowledge that is highly applicable regardless of which kind of data analysis technique you are using. This section assumes zero depth in data science, but even developed data professionals will find something to take away.

TIP: If you are new to coding, you ought to check out our https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/[Examples Books on programming with Python]; it has everything you need to learn Python! Doing the top half of the pages listed under Python will be more than enough to get you started; be sure to type out all the commands yourself (muscle memory when programming is real)!

== Table of Contents

TIP: Links with a * in their name are highly recommended for those new to the data science world in general.

TIP: Working through this sequentially might make the most sense.
