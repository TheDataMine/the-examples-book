= Computer Vision

Computer vision is defined as a "field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to identify and understand objects and people in images and videos." https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-computer-vision/[Microsoft]

== Common Applications

Computer vision is used everywhere and in every industry; think any company that uses humans to visually analyze anything, whether that be traffic, crops, livestock, healthcare diagnostics, security, and much more. Take a look at a few of the ways computer vision is used today. https://viso.ai/applications/computer-vision-applications/[viso.ai] (Take a look at a few of the ways computer vision is used today.)
