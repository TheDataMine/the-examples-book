= Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

Sentiment analysis is the technique of using analyzing language to understand affective states or subjective responses; that is, to study what people feel about a given subject. This could include audio or text, but typically this is used for text. Your sentiment and emotional reactions are constantly being studied every time you like, subscribe, downvote, respond with an emoji, etc.
