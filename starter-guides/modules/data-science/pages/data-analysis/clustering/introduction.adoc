= Clustering

Clustering is an xref:data-modeling/choosing-model/supervision.adoc[unsupervised learning] approach that "clusters" data points based on the type of clustering technique. There are many varieties of clustering out there, such as hierarchical and k-means.

== Common Applications

=== Common Industries

- Agriscience
- Healthcare
- Marketing
- Tech/Social Media

=== Common Problem Types

- Anomaly Identification
- Market Segmentation
- Genetic/Biological Analysis
- Recommender Systems

== Code Examples

NOTE: All of the code examples are written in Python, unless otherwise noted.

=== Containers

TIP: These are code examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks running in a container that come with all the data, libraries, and code you'll need to run it. https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/data-engineering/containers/using-data-mine-containers[Click here to learn why you should be using containers, along with how to do so.]

[source,bash]
----
#pull container, only needs to be run once
docker pull ghcr.io/thedatamine/starter-guides:k-means-clustering

#run container
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it ghcr.io/thedatamine/starter-guides:k-means-clustering
