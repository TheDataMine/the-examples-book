= Power BI

Power BI (Power Business Intelligence) is a Microsoft product aimed at interactive data visualization. Power BI will help you tell stories with data, automating the data visualization process, and integrating data streams. 

== Common Applications

Similar to Tableau, PowerBI gets used by a wide variety of businesses and is common in the toolkit of business/data analysts. Its accessibility and ease of use, robustness, and drag and drop interface makes it great for individuals or smaller/medium sized businesses, and its status as a Microsoft product also makes it more readily accessible for Microsoft shops.

== Do I Need a License?

Power BI is free to download, use and publish, which should cover all projects. There is Power BI Pro for a fee, but Data Mine students probably will not need this (the primary benefit of it is that it enables secured permissions for corporations). Ask your TA if you are unsure.
