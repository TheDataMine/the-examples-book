= The Starter Guides

The Starter Guides are guides handcrafted by Data Mine staff to help you deal with data. Here you will find a brief synopsis on all the major data related topics, as well as some less common ones; books, articles, videos and more to learn more about the topic from; as well as free code samples demonstrating technical topics usually in the form of Notebooks and/or containers. 

== How to Use 

The Starter Guides are meant to be use-it-when-you-need-it, so if you know what topic you are looking for, dig right in! Otherwise, this page can help you get started.

=== Data Engineering Vs. Data Science: What's the Difference?

If you are relatively new to dealing with data, refer to the table below to get a feel for the difference between data engineering and data science.

[cols="3,3,3"]
|===
|Discipline |Data Engineering | Data Science

|Languages Used
|Any; General Purpose Languages Most Common, like Python, Java, C++
| Python, R

|What They Do With Data
|"Move Data Around"; Collect, Organize, Set Up Databases; Set up Cloud Systems
| "Make Sense of Data"; Analyze, Train Models, Make Visualizations

|Common Backgrounds
|Computer Science, IT
|Math, Statistics, Computer Science

|Common Tools
| Hadoop, NoSQL, Spark, Postgresql, Kubernetes, Docker
| MapReduce, Keras, PyTorch, Plotting Packages like GGPlot, JAX

WARNING: While there are debates about whether data science is data engineering and vice versa, or whether they even belong on the same guide together, they are both dependent on each other in some form or fashion, and so we included both as separate categories. For some organizations, people do both! For others, they have multiple departments that share all of those responsibilities; still others draw a much starker line between the two than we have here. One thing is clear: dealing with data always depends on who you deal with, and the jury is still out on the right way to categorize these skills. Nonetheless they overlap in many areas.

=== How is This Guide Organized?

Here's a non exhaustive list of subjects covered in the 3 primary categories on the Starter Guides:

.Tools & Standards
* Data Formats
* Git
* Matlab
* Programming Languages
* Unix
* Data Ethics
* Jupyter Notebook/Lab

.Data Science
* Data Analysis (techniques to help you make sense of data), such as Neural Networks, Unsupervised Learning, Computer Vision, etc
* Data Modeling Process (the general step by step process)
* Data Visualization (how to display data once you've processed it)
* Gathering Data (web scraping, free data sources, data mining)

.Data Engineering
* Containers, like Kubernetess
* Databases, like SQLite
* RCAC (Anvil instructions)
* SLURM
