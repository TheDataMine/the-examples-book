= Connecting to a Windows Server

This guide contains the steps to connect to a Windows server setup and maintained by The Data Mine. 

These servers are used by student teams to access applications like Power BI, Tableau, and ArcGIS Pro. 

[NOTE]
====
Each Windows server in Purdue's environment can be configured differently. 

The instructions below are specific to TDM servers, and may not work for others.
====

. The first step in the process is to ensure that The Data Mine has a Windows survey that is ready for the student team. 
** If you haven't requested a Windows server, please send an email to datamine-help@purdue.edu with your request and the TDM team will assist.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When submitting a ticket to request a Windows server, please include your group's name and the Purdue email for each member of your group. 

The emails will be used to ensure that the team has access.
====

== Cisco VPN
** After the server is requested, each team member will need to install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client. 
* The VPN is required to connect to the server.
. To request the Cisco VPN, navigate to the https://communityhub.purdue.edu//[Purdue Community Hub] website. 
. In the upper-right menu bar of the website, select the first `Software Downloads` option. 
. Log in with your Purdue credentials. 
. In the search bar at the top of the website, search for `anyconnect`.
. From the search results, select `Cisco AnyConnect for Personally Owned Computers`.
. In the top-right of the following page, under `Operating System`, select the OS for your computer and then select `Add to cart`.
. The website will then take you to a page that has a summary of your software requests. In the middle-right of the page there is a button that has a `Checkout` option. Make sure the software listed is correct, then click `Checkout`. 
. On the following page, no additional notes or comments are required. You can click `Next`. 
. The confirmation page will provide a summary of your order. If everything looks good, click `Place order`.
. The `Order summary` page will provide a `Download` button on the right-middle of the screen, under the `Notes` column. Click this button to download your software. 
. Once the software is downloaded, you should be ready to install Cisco AnyConnect VPN on your computer. 
** No changes are required to the installer and you should be able to click through the installation.

[TIP]
====
If you lose internet connection after installing the VPN, restart your computer. 

This should resolve the issue. 
====

** Once the VPN is installed, you can launch a connection that will start with the screen below. The VPN app has multiple fields, but we really only use the very top of the application under the `VPN:` header. In the field, type `webvpn2.purdue.edu` and select `Connect`. This will launch a connection to Purdue's VPN. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The VPN client still uses the old PIN,PUSH method of authentication. 

After clicking `Connect`, you'll need to add your Purdue PIN then a comma and then the word `push` for DUO to send you an authentication request. 

If you have any trouble with this, Purdue IT should be able to assist

== Remote Desktop Client

After the Cisco VPN is installed, the other piece that is needed to connect to the server is the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client or `RDP`. 

For Windows computers, `RDP` is automatically installed. Mac users need to navigate to the App Store and request the free `Microsoft Remote Desktop` for their computers. 

== Windows Server Connection

Once you have both the Cisco VPN and RDP, you should be ready for your server connection!

. Launch and connect to Cisco VPN using `webvpn2.purdue.edu`.
. Open the RDP app and select `Add PC`.
. Enter the server name provided by TDM. 
** This only needs to be done once. After that, the server will appear as an option in RDP. 
. Click `Connect`.
** Please note, this will require DUO authentication.
