= Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

:imagesdir: ../images

Visual Studio Code, also known as VS Code, is a powerful source-code editor developed by Microsoft.  It includes features such as syntax highlighting, debugging, code completion, embedded git support, and a wealth of extensions to customize and enhance the editing experience.  VS Code is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  In The Data Mine, the Linux version of VS Code on Anvil can be particularly useful for some Corporate Partner projects.

== How can I launch VS Code on Anvil?

The following assumes you already have accounts on ACCESS and Anvil.

To launch VS Code on Anvil, browse to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu and authenticate normally.

Once logged in, at the very top of the browser window you will select the _The Data Mine_ -> _Visual Studio Code_ dropdown menu.  You'll select a number of hours to run, a number of CPU cores to use, and a Starting Directory.  For the number of hours to run, select a time slightly longer than you think you will need.  As soon as you hit the time limit, your session will be terminated. Estimating a bit more time than you think you need will keep your session from terminating too quickly.  The number of CPU cores you should select depends upon whether you plan to actually execute or debug code within VS Code, and how large the memory and CPU requirements for the code you want to debug or execute will be.  For doing simple text editing a single CPU core will be sufficient!  If you are debugging python code, or executing a more complex framework such as streamlit, you will want to choose more CPU cores, which in turn will give you more memory.  It's convenient to select the starting directory to be close to where you intend to work, but you can always navigate to any directory once you launch VS Code anyway, so it's not terribly important to get this exactly right at the time you launch VS Code.  Once these choices have been made, click the _Launch_ button to submit a request to launch VS Code.  Once it is ready, you can click the _Connect to VS Code_ button, which will open VS Code in a new browser tab.

== Initial Configuration of VS Code

There are a few configuration changes you should make the first time you launch Visual Studio Code.

*1)* If the _File, Edit, Selection, View, Go, Run, Terminal, Help_ menu bar does not appear at the top as seen here:

image::vscode-file-menu.png[]

you will want to enable it by clicking the hamburger menu (the three horizontal lines in the upper left), then View -> Appearance -> Menu Bar as shown below:

image::vscode-hamburger-menu.png[]

If this doesn't work for some reason, you can enable it a different way by opening the _Command Palette_ by pressing the `F1` key in the upper left part of your keyboard and then in the search box that appears, type `View Toggle Menu Bar` and press the enter key.  On some laptops you may have to press the `Fn` key on your keyboard and the `F1` key simultaneously.  If you are still unable to open the _Command Palette_, you can click the gear in the extreme lower left, then select _Command Palette_ and then type `View Toggle Menu Bar` and press `Enter`.

*2)* The next thing will be to install a few extensions so VS Code knows how to edit and debug Python and R. To do so, click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar as shown:

image::vscode-extension-icon.png[]

Then in the _Search Extensions in Marketplace_ box enter `python`.  It will find many extensions for python, but the one you should select looks like this:

image::vscode-python-extension.png[]

and is titled _Python_ with description _IntelliSense (Pylance), Linting, Debugging..._ authored by _ms-python_.  Click the blue `Install` button next to this extension to install it.

Then in the _Search Extensions in Marketplace_ box enter `R`.  It will find many extensions for R, but the two you should select look like this:

image::vscode-r-extensions.png[]

and are titled _R_ with description _R Extension for Visual Studio Code_ authored by _REditorSupport_, and _R Debugger_ with description _R Debugger for VS Code_, by _RDebugger_.  Click the blue `Install` button next to each of these extensions to install them.

*3)* Now that we have the Python extension installed we have to tell VS Code which Python Interpreter to use.  By default, it will not use the Data Mine version of Python available via the _seminar_ kernel, but will use a rather old version with very few Python packages.  We want to tell it to use the Data Mine version of Python, which includes over 700 additional Python packages like Pandas, Numpy, machine learning libraries, etc.  To tell it to use the Data Mine version, open the _Command Palette_ by pressing the `F1` key in the upper left part of your keyboard or clicking the gear in the lower left and selecting _Command Palette_, then in the search box type `python select interpreter` and press enter.  Click on _+ Enter interpreter path..._, then paste the following:  `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3` and press `Enter`.

All of the above changes will be remembered for all future invocations of VS Code so they you shouldn't have to repeat them again.

*4)* Optionally change the theme from light to dark by clicking the gear in the lower left, then selecting _Themes_ and then _Color Theme_, then select something like _Dark (Visual Studio)_.

== Debugging Python Code

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging.
There are many possible configuration options discussed here that are not strictly necessary.  You may want to jump ahead on this page to the _Basic Debugging_ section.

== Using the Python package Streamlit With VS Code

Some python libraries like _streamlit_ and _flask_ require you to launch them from a terminal window at a bash prompt by typing something like `streamlit run filename.py`.  This will launch a _streamlit_ program you can connect to using your web browser and interact with graphically.  VS Code makes this easy!

There are some one-time steps you must first take for _streamlit_ to work with VS Code.  You must create a `.streamlit` directory in your home directory and then create three special files within that `.streamlit` directory with specific names and contents.  This can be done by executing the following under bash from a Terminal window launched from Jupyter Notebook, from a `%%bash` code cell in Jupyter Notebook, or any number of other ways:

[source,bash]
----

mkdir -p ~/.streamlit
cat > ~/.streamlit/config.toml << HERE
[server]
enableXsrfProtection=false
enableCORS=false
[browser]
serverAddress = "localhost"
HERE
cat > ~/.streamlit/credentials.toml << HERE
[general]
email = ""
HERE
cat > ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml << HERE
password = "TDMisgreat"
HERE

----

The last file, `~/.streamlit/secrets.toml`, includes a password that we can optionally require to access our streamlit applications.  This is done to make sure no one outside of your Corporate Partners group can connect to your streamlit server while you are running it.  This is already unlikely since they would have to have a session on the same Anvil back-end node as you while you are running streamlit, and they would have to actively try to connect to the right port.  Even though it's unlikely, it's still prudent to use a password to prevent any any accidental exposure of sensitive data.  Be sure to edit this file and change the password from the default above!  Note that the password requirement is not enforced by your streamlit programs by default.  You must explicitly add code to your streamlit script to require a password and check it against the one we have saved in our `secrets.toml` file.  Here is some example python code that does that.  Your programs should include this code to enable password protection:


[source,python]
----

import hmac
import streamlit as st


def check_password():
    """Returns `True` if the user had the correct password."""

    def password_entered():
        """Checks whether a password entered by the user is correct."""
        if hmac.compare_digest(st.session_state["password"], st.secrets["password"]):
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = True
            del st.session_state["password"]  # Don't store the password.
        else:
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = False

    # Return True if the passward is validated.
    if st.session_state.get("password_correct", False):
        return True

    # Show input for password.
    st.text_input(
        "Password", type="password", on_change=password_entered, key="password"
    )
    if "password_correct" in st.session_state:
        st.error("Password incorrect")
    return False


if not check_password():
    st.stop()  # Do not continue if check_password is not True.

# Main Streamlit app starts here.
# Anything below here is only run if the password is correct.
st.write("Put the rest of your streamlit app here!!!")
st.button("Click me")


----

Let's say you've saved the above python code to the file `mystreamlit.py`.  To actually execute this using VS Code launched from an Anvil VS Code session you will select the _Terminal_ -> _New Terminal_ dropdown menu, and from within that Terminal pane type:


[source,bash]
----

streamlit run mystreamlit.py

----

VS Code will recognize that you have launched a streamlit application that is now listening on a specific port.  It will ask you if you would like to open a new browser tab connected to that tab.  Click _Open in Browser_!  It will look like this:

image::vscode-streamlit-open.png[]

Switch to the new tab and you should be prompted for the password used in `~/.streamlit/secrets.toml` and it should then run the streamlit app!

When you want to terminate your streamlit app, you can press Control-c in the VS Code Terminal pane like this:
