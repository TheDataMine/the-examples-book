= Unix Kernels

== The Unix operation system has a `kernel` that handles the memory allocated to each program and manages the time when the programs run.  The kernel also handles I/O (input and output).  See Figure 1-1 on https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch01.html#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-4[on page 8 of Unix Power Tools] and also https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch01.html#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-10[the discussion on pages 14-16 of Unix Power Tools].

== Unix Processes

To see the processes running on a node, you can type: `ps x` or `top`.  If you type `top`, you will see the processes change in real time, including the amount of memory allocated to each process and the percentage of the processor's time allocated to each process.  To quit the view from `top` you can type the letter `q`.
