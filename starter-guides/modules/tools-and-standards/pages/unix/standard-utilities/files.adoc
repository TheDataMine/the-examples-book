= files

In Unix, everything is a file; see https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch01.html#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-19[page 27 of the Unix Power Tools].

When manipulating files in Unix, it is necessary to remember that Unix text files have a newline at the end of each line.  Windows files, in contrast, have a carriage return and then a newline.  Macintosh files may have a carriage return or a newline.  Sometimes it is necessary convert files from one type to another, and (in particular) it is sometimes necessary to change the types of characters at the end of each line of text.
