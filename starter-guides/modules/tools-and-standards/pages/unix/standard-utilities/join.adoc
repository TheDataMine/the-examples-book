= join

There is a `join` command, much like the "JOIN" in databases, that enables us to join two files.  When it joins the two files together, there needs to be a column in the first file that has the same type of information as a column in the second file.  The information within each of these two columns does not need to be in the same order.  The `join` command will put together the contents from the two files in such a way that corresponding rows are joined together.

FIXTHIS we definitely need to put a good example here, demonstrating how to specify the columns.  For instance, we could take (say) 50 flights and the corresponding airport addresses, and make a new file.  We could even do this twice in a row, to join the origin airports to the titles and addresses of the airports and then again (with a secone application of `join`) to join the destination airports to the titles and addresses of the airports.
