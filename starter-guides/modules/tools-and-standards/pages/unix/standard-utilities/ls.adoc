= `ls`

`ls` (think _list_) is one of the most-used commands in Unix-like operating systems. `ls` prints the files and sub-directories located in the current working directory, or, in the directory specified as an argument by the user. 

`ls` is incredibly useful for navigation. When working with a graphical user interface (GUI), like Finder in MacOS or File Explorer in Windows, the files and folders in a directory are shown to you each time you navigate to and from a specific directory. 

When navigating files and folders via a shell, this is not quite as straightforward. When using xref:book:unix:cd.adoc[`cd`] to navigate to a particular directory, you will _not_ have a nice list of files and folders presented to you upon navigating to said directory. Instead, we use `ls` to _list_ the files and folders, and see what options we have for navigation. For example, let's say our current working directory is `/home/john/`, and we want to go to our projects folder (`/home/john/projects`) to see what projects we have. To navigate to our projects folder, we can use `cd`.

[source,bash]
----
cd projects
----

Unfortunately, `cd` will simply change your current working directory, and that is _all_ that will happen. How do you know what projects reside in our projects folder? Well, we can use `ls` to list the files and folders in our projects folder.

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

.Output
----
project_1   project_2
project_3   project_4
readme.txt  
----

Now, we know we can use `cd` to navigate to any of the following project folders: `project_1`, `project_2`, `project_3`, and `project_4`. Let's navigate to our `project_1` folder, and list the files and folders in our `project_1` folder.

[source, bash]
----
cd project_1
ls
----

This would result in an output that looks something like this.

[source, bash]
----
schedule.pdf    code.py     STAT_190    MA_165 
----

Here you can see that there are two files, and two sub-directories located in the `project_1` directory. From here, you can `cd` into the `STAT_190` or the `MA_165` sub-directory.

`ls` and `cd` are often used hand-in-hand. This makes sense: it is unlikely that you will remember the files located in each directory and sub-directory when navigating in the terminal.

== options

Like most unix utilities, there are many options that are used with `ls`. The following is an example of using `ls` with the `-a` option.

[source, bash]
----
ls -a
----

Here are a few, and what they do!

* `-a`: list all files, including hidden files.
* `-l`: outputs the files in the directory in a list format.
* `-S`: sorts the output by the size of each file (please note that this is a *capital* S).
* `-h`: stands for "human-readable" and outputs the size of each file in a human-readable format.
* `-R`: recursively lists files in the current directory and (recursively) in all subdirectories, including child directories, grandchild directories, etc.

Multiple options can be given 1-by-1, like in the following example.

[source,bash]
----
ls -a -l

# order of options does not matter
ls -l -a
----

Or, rather than providing a new dash for each option, you can "smash" every option together.

[source,bash]
----
ls -la

# order still doesn't matter
ls -al
----

Dr Ward usually uses `ls -la`, which lists all files (including hidden files) and outputs the files in the directory in a list format.

For instance, in the directory `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/fars` if we type: `ls -la` we get the following results:

[source,bash]
----
x-mdw@login04.anvil:[fars] $ ls -la

----

We see that there is one directory for each year from 1975 to 2021, and a file called `7581.csv` and a file called `states.csv`.

Each line describes the permissions of a file or directory, the number of hard links to the file or directory, the owner of the file or directory, the UNIX group associated with that file or directory, the number of bytes, the date of the last modification, and the names of the file or directory.

To see the recursive file listing in practice, you might (for instance) look at the AirBnB directory recursively:

`ls -R /anvil/projects/tdm/data/airbnb`
