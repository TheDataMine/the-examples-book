= wc

The `wc` utility is very handy for counting the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.

We can run `wc` on individual files.  For instance, we can see that the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/consumer_complaints/complaints.csv` has 7078918 lines, 374350052 words, and 2655317486 characters.

[source,bash]
----
wc /anvil/projects/tdm/data/consumer_complaints/complaints.csv
----

We can just get the number of lines using `wc -l` or the number of words using `wc -w` or the number of characters `wc -c`.

Sometimes we want to check the number of lines, words, and characters in a collection of files, for instance, we can check the number of lines, words, and characters in all of the `itcont` files in the directory `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election`, like this:

[source,bash]
----
cat /anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont*.txt | wc
----

We see that, altogether, in the `itcont*.txt` files, there are 229169299 lines, 1385963208 words, and 42790681570 characters altogether.
