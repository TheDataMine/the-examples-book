= rmdir

`rmdir` is a simple and straightforward function that removes a directory, if, and only if, it is empty.

If you try and remove a non-empty directory using `rmdir` you will get an error. To remove a non-empty directory, you must use the xref:book:unix:rm.adoc[`rm`] command with the `-r` flag.
