= grep

The `grep` utility is used for searching for regular expressions in files.  There are many variants of the `grep` command.  In its most simple form

[source,bash]
----
grep mypattern myfiles
----

will find `mypattern` in the set of `myfiles`.  

For example,

[source,bash]
----
grep "garlic" recipes/*.txt
----

will check for the word "garlic" in every text file in the `recipes` directory.

Dr Ward often uses `grep` as part of a pipeline.  For instance, if there is a large directory that contains a mix of `csv` and `pdf` and `txt` files, and we want to see all of the files *except* the `pdf` files, we can use `grep -v` which will exclude the lines with the specified pattern, like this:

[source,bash]
----
ls | grep -v ".pdf"
----
