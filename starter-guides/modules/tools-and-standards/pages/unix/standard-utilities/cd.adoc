= `cd`

Navigating directories is one of the most used (and most basic) skills you will develop when using Unix-like operating systems. `cd` is essential to properly navigate, a filesystem from a shell. 

`cd` is short for "change directory". The command accepts an _absolute path_ or a _relative path_ as an argument, and changes your current working directory to the given location. This is something that you have been doing your whole life (like when you are trying to find a file on your computer; you change directories a lot!).

If you were to attempt to navigate into a folder using a GUI, you would double-click on the folder with the name that you would like to navigate to. Using `cd`, it is almost as easy. Simply type `cd` into your terminal, followed by the name of the directory that you would like to navigate to. If you wanted to navigate into the `school` folder on your computer, you would do following.

[source, bash]
----
cd school
----

This changes your working directory to the path of the `school` directory. Remember, if you want to print your current working directory, you can use the xref:book:unix:pwd.adoc[`pwd`] command.

Sometimes, you will find that you are in the wrong folder, and instead you want to be in the parent directory (the directory that _contains_ the directory you are currently in). To go "up one level" to the parent directory, you type `cd ..` where `..` is a shortcut for "parent directory". You can read more about `..` xref:book:unix:special-symbols.adoc[here].

An example of this would be the following scenario. Let's say that you mistakenly navigated into the `school` directory (`/home/john/project/school`), and want to go to the `project` directory (the parent directory for `school`). To do so, you could run the following command.

[source, bash]
----
cd ..
----

Note that there is a space between `cd` and `..`!

`cd` is a very powerful and simple tool.  Soon you will find yourself using it without even knowing. Remember when we said "Using `cd`, is almost as easy" (as using a GUI) -- well in fact, it is easier! If you are double-clicking through a deep set of folders, it could take you a while to get to the right place. With `cd`, you can navigate to your desired directory with a single command.

For instance, you can navigate directly to The Data Mine data sets folder as follows:

[source, bash]
----
cd /anvil/projects/tdm/data/
----

== Navigating to one's home directory

When you want to navigate immediately to your home directory, you can type:

[source, bash]
----
cd
----

without specifying a directory, and by default the shell will take you directly back to your home directory.

For instance, when Dr Ward types `cd` the shell takes Dr Ward directly to his home directory: `/home/x-mdw`

== Absolute versus relative filenames

It is always possible to provide an absolute directory location when using `cd` for instance:

[source, bash]
----
cd /anvil/projects/tdm/data/
----

In this example, `/anvil` is the base directory, with `/projects` inside it, etc.  Note that we use `/` at the start of a directory location only when giving the absolute path (i.e., the full path) to a directory, i.e., when starting with the base directory and giving all of the directories from the root to the desired directory location.

On the other hand, it is possible to give relative paths, which do not start with a `/`.  For instance, if we are already working in the directory `/anvil/projects` we can navigate to the `data` directory by typing:

[source, bash]
----
cd tdm/data/
----

Notice that we did *not* start with a slash in the path.  If we had (incorrectly) started with `/tdm` then the shell would look for `/tdm` at the base directory and would not find this directory.

We leave the slash off, when we want a relative path, in other words, when we want to navigate to a directory in the same place where we are already working.

== Referencing files in one's home directory

A tilde and `$HOME` both refer to a user's home directory.  For instance, `~/myfile.txt` and `$HOME/myfile.txt` both refer to a file called `myfile.txt` in Dr Ward's home directory.  Each of these can be used from anywhere in the file system, to easily access files from one's home directory.
