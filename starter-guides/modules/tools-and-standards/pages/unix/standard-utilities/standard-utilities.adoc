The following is a curated list of standard utilities that are commonly used when working in the terminal of a UNIX-like operating system. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Have another utility that is not listed here? Please feel free to xref:book:ROOT:how-to-contribute.adoc[make a contribution]. See a mistake? Please https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/issues[open an issue] and we will get to it as soon as possible.

Nearly every utility in this book will have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page[man pages] that can be accessed using `man`. The man pages are frequently the _best_ place to read about a utility and its various options.
