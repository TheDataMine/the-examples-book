= cut

We can use `cut` to extract information from a text file.  We usually just need to specify the delimited between the fields of data, using the `-d` option, and we also need to specify the fields to extract, using the `-f` option.  For example, we can display the city and state of the donations to federal election campaigns.

[source,bash]
----
cut -d"|" -f9,10 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont2024.txt | head
----

FIXTHIS we need to check the example above, and probably add a few more examples from some other data sets, using different delimiters, and maybe using a range of fields.

FIXTHIS See section 21.14 of the Unix Power Tools book

If you need to do more sophisticated work with columns, it is helpful to know that `awk` can do everything that `cut` can do, as well as many more things.  Sometimes it is nice to just have the simplicity of `cut`, and other times it is necessary to have the power of `awk`.
