= `type`

`type` is a utility that shows you how its arguments would be interpreted if run as a command. There are four "types" of Unix utilities, and the `type` command displays the passed utilities type.

The four "types" of Unix utilities are:

* Executables
* Shell built-ins
* Shell functions
* Aliases

Here is how the `type` command is used:

[source, bash]
----
type ls
----

When you run this on your local machine, you might see something like this:

.Output
----
ls is /bin/ls
----

This means that the `ls` command is an executable. Most likely, you will not be using this command each and every day. But like which, it may come in handy down the road, and is a great tool to have in your toolbox.

One example where `type` may come in handy is when trying to figure out where the `module` command is located on Scholar. You may be thinking, we can use `which` for this, but it will not have the information you want.

[source,bash]
----
which module
----

.Output
----
/usr/bin/which: no module in (...)
----

The reason is that `module` is a shell built-in, and `which` is a utility that shows you where the command is located, not where a _function_ is located. `type`, however, can help you out.

[source,bash]
----
type -f module
----

.Output
----
module () {
	eval $($LMOD_CMD bash "$@") && eval $(${LMOD_SETTARG_CMD:-:} -s sh)
}
----
