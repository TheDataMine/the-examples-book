= man

`man` stands for "manual" and is a command which presents the "man pages" for a particular command. 

What are "man pages"? Man pages are text documents that describe the utility or command, what it does, how to use it, and what options are available to use. It is one of the best resources to learn about a given command. The `man` command should be your first stop to learn about a new command.

To see the "man pages" for the `cat` command, you can run the following.

[source,bash]
----
man cat
----

You will then be presented with text describing the `cat` command and its various options. To scroll down in the presented interface, press the "j" button on your keyboard, or use the down arrow key, or the space bar. To scroll up, press the "k" button or the up arrow key. To quit the man pages, press the "q" button (for quit).

== whatis

Closely related to the `man` command is the `whatis` command, which gives a one-line summary of a command.  For instnace, here is the operation of `whatis cat` and `whatis nano` and `whatis vi` and `whatis head`

[source,bash]
----
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[~] $ man -f cat
cat (1p)             - concatenate and print files
cat (1)              - concatenate files and print on the standard output
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[~] $ whatis cat
cat (1p)             - concatenate and print files
cat (1)              - concatenate files and print on the standard output
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[~] $ whatis nano
nano (1)             - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[~] $ whatis vi
vi (1p)              - screen-oriented (visual) display editor
vi (1)               - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[~] $ whatis head
head (1p)            - copy the first part of files
HEAD (1)             - Simple command line user agent
head (1)             - output the first part of files

== whereis

The `whereis` command shows where a program is available.  For instance, here is the operation of `whereis` for `emacs`, `vi`, `nano`, `man`, and `cd`.

[source,bash]
----
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[data] $ whereis emacs
emacs: /usr/share/emacs
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[data] $ whereis vi
vi: /usr/bin/vi /usr/share/man/man1p/vi.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1.gz
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[data] $ whereis nano
nano: /usr/bin/nano /usr/share/nano /usr/share/man/man1/nano.1.gz /usr/share/info/nano.info.gz
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[data] $ whereis man
man: /usr/bin/man /usr/share/man /usr/share/man/man7/man.7.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/man.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/man.1.gz
x-mdw@login06.anvil:[data] $ whereis cd
cd: /usr/bin/cd /usr/share/man/man1p/cd.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/cd.1.gz

== type and which

Another way to check where a command is located is to use `type` or `which`; see https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch02.html#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-6[page 36 in Section 2.6 of Unix Power Tools]

For instance, we could check:

`type cat` and `type nano` and `type vi` and `type head`

and in `bash` we can type:

`type -all cat` and `type -all nano` and `type -all vi` and `type -all head`

and

`which cat` and `which nano` and `which vi` and `which head`
