= Jupyter Lab Kernels

== The kernel in Jupyter Lab controls how each cell is interpreted, and handles the running of the cell accordingly.

=== If you select the `seminar` kernel, then the default behavior is that each cell is interpreted as `python` code.  You can write `%%R` at the start of a cell, to tell the kernel that the cell contains `R` code.  Alternatively, you can write `%%sql` or `%%bash` at the start of a cell, to tell the kernel that the cell contains `sql` or `bash` code, respectively.

It is possible to interrupt the kernel and/or restart the kernel.  Sometimes the kernel will die on its own, for instance, if the amount of memory allocated to the kernel is exceeded.  In such a case, you can just restart the kernel and try to run your work again.

=== If you select the `seminar-r` kernel, then the kernel will interpret every cell as `R` code, without the need to type `%%R` at the start of each cell.

The Data Mine will usually specify which Jupyter Lab Kernel to use for a project.  If you are unsure, it is always OK to ask Dr Ward for clarification.
