= bash Overview

bash is a `shell`, which runs in the terminal.  bash stands for "the Bourne Again SHell".  The bash shell allows people to interact with the operation system, directory system, and files, in a very fast and efficient way.  It is low-level and takes a little time to get used to.  It is not too difficult to learn, and once a person knows how to use the bash shell, it becomes much easier to do powerful things in UNIX with relative ease and efficiency.
