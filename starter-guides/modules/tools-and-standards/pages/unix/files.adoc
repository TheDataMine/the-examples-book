= Files

In Unix, everything is a file; see https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch01.html#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-19[page 27 of the Unix Power Tools].

== Line Endings

When manipulating files in Unix, it is necessary to remember that Unix text files have a newline at the end of each line.  Windows files, in contrast, have a carriage return and then a newline.  Macintosh files may have a carriage return or a newline.  Sometimes it is necessary convert files from one type to another, and (in particular) it is sometimes necessary to change the types of characters at the end of each line of text.

== Naming files in Unix

It is advisable to use only letters, numbers, underscores, and periods in file names in Unix.

Please try to avoid putting spaces in Unix filenames.  If you use a space in a filename, it leads to difficulties, for instance, needing to put double quotes around a file name, or needing to put a backslash to escape each space:  `"this looks ugly.txt"` or `my\ silly\ file\ name.txt`

Filenames are also case sensitive.  In other words, `thisismyfile.txt` and `ThisIsMyFile.txt` are different files.  You will get comfortable with file naming conventions and will develop your own style.  Dr Ward likes to use (mostly) lowercase letters in his files names, for instance, `myexample.txt`.  Some people like to use camel back notation, in which the first word in a file name is not capitalized, but the other words are capitalized, for instance, `thisIsMyFile.txt`.

== File Extensions

Unix usually does not treat files differently, regardless of the file extension.  Nonetheless, especially when working with data, it can be helpful to name files in such a way that a user can guess what kind of data is inside the file.

For instance:

* .csv for comma-separated text files (i.e., with commas between text fields)
* .tsv for tab-separated text files (i.e., with tabs between text fields)
* .txt for text files with other separators or without any separators
* .db for database files
* .sh for bash shell scripts
* .gz, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .z, .Z, .zip for compressed files
* .html, .htm, .xhtml, .xml for HTML or XML files
* .ps for Postscript files
* .pdf for Adobe pdf files
* .c or .cpp for C or C++ source files, respectively
* a.out is the default name for executable files created by C++
* file extensions are usually not used with directory names (in other words, it looks weird to use a period in a directory name)

== Searching for files

When using `ls` or `mv` or `grep` or other shell commands to work with files, it is possible to identify multiple files using wildcards.  A question mark `?` allows matching for any one character.  For example:

`rm drwardfile?.csv`

would remove (for instance) the files `drwardfile1.csv` through `drwardfile5.csv` and also the files `drwardfileA.csv` and `drwardfileB.csv` and `drwardfileC.csv` etc.

An asterisk `*` matches any number of occurrences of any group of characters.  For instance, if we type

`mv mystate*data.txt staterepository`

we could move the files `mystateINdata.txt` and `mystateILdata.txt` and `mystateOHdata.txt` and `mystateMIdata.txt` etc. into the directory `staterepository`.  Such a command would also move any files named, for instance, `mystate1999data.txt` or `mystatedata.txt` or `mystateasdFGhJKl1234data.txt` would all be moved into the directory `staterepository` too.

Similarly, `rm *.csv` would remove all files with the extension `.csv` at the end.  The command `rm *` removes all files in the current directory.

It is also possible to put specific characters or ranges of characters.  For instance, `mv myfiles199[0-9].txt ninetiesfolder` will move all files from `myfiles1990.txt` to `myfiles199o.txt` into the directory `ninetiesfolder`.

Recently Dr Ward wanted to remove all files ending with `.csv` and `.CSV` and even files ending in anything in between, for instance, `.Csv`, and he used `rm *.[Cc][Ss][Vv]` as one way to achieve the removal of all of these files at once.

==

Unix stores files in a hierarchical structure, with directories (also called folders) and files or more directories inside, possibly over and over.  The Mac and Windows operating systems have similar structures of directories (or folders) and files.

See Figure 1-3 of "A Unix filesystem tree" example in https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch01.html#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-14[Section 1.14 of Unix Power Tools]

Some examples from Anvil include, for instance:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data`

is the directory for the data sets from The Data Mine projects, and

`/home/x-mdw`

is Dr Ward's home directory.

== Links to Files

https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ch10.html[Chapter 10 of the Unix Power Tools book] has a great deal of information about how to establish links to files in Unix, including what happens when moving or copying files, and also information about how things work with links in the operating system behind-the-scenes.  We do not focus on links to files here, but if you are interested, there are a variety of examples posted there to consider.

== Differences between files

The `diff` and `cmp` commands can be used to compare differences between files.  For instance:

`diff myfile1.txt myfile2.txt`

shows any differences between these two files.  The lines with `<` at the beginning show the content of `myfile1.txt` that is missing from `myfile2.txt`, and similarly, the lines with `>` at the beginning show the content of `myfile2.txt` that is missing from `myfile1.txt`.

If the two files are identical, then `diff` will not print any output.

On the other hand,

`cmp myfile1.txt myfile2.txt`

compares the two files but only shows the location of the first difference in the two files.  For this reason, `cmp` is often faster than `diff`.  As with the `diff` command, the `cmp` will not print any output if the two files are identical.
