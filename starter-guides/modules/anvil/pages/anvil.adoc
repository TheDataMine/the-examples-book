= Anvil

https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil] is a great new supercomputer that was funded by the National Science Foundation. Anvil helps to expand the resources available for the NSF's https://portal.xsede.org/#/guest[Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)], which was ended as a funded project on August 31st, 2022. The success of XSEDE led the NSF to follow up with xref:https://access-ci.org/[ACCESS], which is now what provides us access to Anvil.

Similar to Scholar and Brown, the Anvil cluster allows The Data Mine to run our R and Python environments on world-class research computing resources. These resources give teams access to computing power and assets like GPUs.
