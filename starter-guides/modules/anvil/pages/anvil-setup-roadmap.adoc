= Anvil Setup Roadmap

This document is a guide to the initial setup and use of an ACCESS ID and the Anvil platform. 

By the time the guide is completed, you will have:

* A working ACCESS ID. 
* Setup security for The Data Mine's project directories. 
** This assumes you are working as part of a Corporate Partners Project. 
* The skills to launch a new working session on Anvil. 

How long does the setup process take?

* It can take 24-48 hours to complete all of the steps above.
** This time is primarily for account creation and syncing. The steps to launch a new session on Anvil are much shorter 
* This does include manual steps that The Data Mine needs to complete. The steps may not be completed on weekends. 

== Step 1 - ACCESS ID

Overview: ACCESS is a portal that allows researchers to use different computing resources. An ACCESS ID is required for a new user to be added to The Data Mine's computing resources. 

ACCESS attempts to use existing authentication when possible. Because of this there are a few different ways to sign up:

[TIP]
====
Follow the steps below to use your University's authentication. 

If your University doesn't exist in the ACCESS portal, that's OK! 

Just follow the steps for number 3 below.
====

. If you have a Purdue ID and email, follow the steps here: https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/purdue-user-setup[Purdue setup]
. If you're from a University other than Purdue, follow the steps here: https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/general-user-setup[Non-Purdue University setup]
. If you didn't find your University in step 2 or your from a corporation, follow the steps here: https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/other-user-setup[ACCESS authentication setup]

What does this do?

* Once you've completed this process, The Data Mine will have an ACCESS ID associated with your email. This is the ID that The Data Mine uses to give you access to our systems. 
* That's why it's important to send The Data Mine your ID, once it's setup.

== Step 2 - Adding to The Data Mine's allocation

This is a step that The Data Mine needs to complete to add the new ACCESS ID to our allocation. 

Once the ID has been added, you'll be able to log-in to ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu with your ACCESS ID. 

[TIP]
====
If you ever forget your ACCESS ID and password, check out the links on our https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/access-helpful-links[ACCESS links page].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Often, when users try to log in to ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu they will see a message saying `Failed to map user` followed by their ACCESS ID. 

This means that the ACCESS ID has been created, but it hasn't been added to The Data Mine's allocation. 

If you see this message and it's been more than 48 hours, send an email to datamine-help@purdue.edu with your ACCESS ID and we'll get you added. 
====

== Step 3 - Data Mine directory permissions

Once step 2 is complete, you'll be able to log in to ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu! 

Step 3 is specific to students who are part of the Corporate Partners projects. 

If you're a student who is only taking seminar, you can skip to the next step. 

For anyone in Corporate Partners, The Data Mine will add you to a project directory that is specific to your team. The directories can be found at `/anvil/projects/tdm/corporate` followed by the directory name for your team. 

[TIP]
====
Similar to the process in step 2, this update requires a process that The Data Mine runs. 

It can take up to 24 hours for these directories to by synced. 

If it's been more than 24 hours, please email datamine-help@purdue.edu. 

Include your ACCESS ID and Corporate Partners team name and we'll help to make sure you get access. 
====

== Step 4 - Using Anvil 

After you've completed all the steps above, you should have an ACCESS ID, the ability to log-in to ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu, and access to a specific team directory (if you're in Corporate Partners). 

Now you're ready to write code on Anvil. The Data Mine makes applications, such as Jupyter Notebook and VSCode, available for both seminar and Corporate Partners use. 

The steps below walk through the different parts of the Anvil platform:

====
If you're a student in Corporate Partners, you'll need to create a link to your project directory. 

This can be done by creating a https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/anvil-getting-started#helpful-tips[symlink].
