== TA Responsibility Overview

TAs are a key part of success in The Data Mine. Your constant support in seminars, grading, and office hours keeps the courses running smoothly. 

The Seminar TA position comprises *three* roles: Student-facing, Grader, or Hybrid TAs.

=== Student-facing TAs
Student-facing TAs are responsible for holding office hours and helping students with their projects.

=== Grader TAs
Grader TAs are responsible for grading student projects and providing feedback.

=== Hybrid TAs
Hybrid TAs are responsible for both student-facing and grading responsibilities. Next semester, only 301 TAs are hybrid.


All TAs should review the upcoming week's projects and solutions to be best prepared to assist students.

You can find a detailed calendar for next semester's weekly project schedule link:https://app.box.com/s/njk0g47rjxmw5bzig0k2mmspnmmencnf[here].

== Monday Seminar

Each Monday, Dr. Ward hosts seminar sessions for all students in the Data Mine to attend. These sessions are held in Hillenbrand Dining Court's atrium. 

The seminar times for Spring 2024 are:

- 8:30-9:30 AM
- 9:30-10:30 AM
- 10:30 -11:30 AM
- 4:30-5:30 PM (Virtual)

For the first four weeks of the semester, we need a few TAs (at least *four* for 10200, *two* for 20200, and *one* for 30200) in each seminar time.

[NOTE]
====
If you attend the seminar, you can log an extra hour in SuccessFactors. It would be in addition to your required office hours.
====

== Office Hours 

**Graders can skip over the office hours section and go to the xref:grading.adoc[Grading] section.**

TAs will choose their office hours times and will be expected to hold their scheduled office hours consistently each week.

We need lots of help on Thursday and Friday. Evenings are much appreciated because we have students all over the world who will need help. Friday evenings are prime time, and we permit more than one TA to work at a time.

Please keep track of how many students come to each of your office hours for weekly reporting. If needed, we will reshuffle a bit based on popular times after the first four weeks.

- **Office hours _before_ 5:00 PM EST:** Hillenbrand Hall Lobby C100 
- **Office hours _after_ 5:00 PM EST:** Online in Zoom +
- **Office hours on the _weekend_:** Online in Zoom

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Your online Zoom meeting room should always be ON during in-person office hours.**

**You need to have your camera ON in all your Zoom calls.**

The staff will randomly join office hour meetings to ensure this is followed.
====

=== Set up your Zoom meeting room
All TAs will utilize on central zoom room to conduct all office hours. The link and additional information will be shared before the start of spring classes.

=== Choose your time
When choosing your office hour time slot(s), please consider your schedule and conflicts such as classes.

We encourage all TAs to hold office hours that impact the most students - you should aim to help as many students as you can. 

*Your help during office hours could change a student's day, week, month, or semester!* 

On *January 4, 2024,*, you will be sent another email in which you will find a link to a spreadsheet to choose your weekly office hours time.

=== Unable to host office hours
If, for a certain day, you are unable to hold office hours, message the Head TA on Teams with a valid conflict and get approval to skip office hours. *If approved*, please post an instructor note in Piazza at least *48 hours before* to all the students

If it is an *emergency* and you cannot do the above in time, message the Head TA on Teams and post an instructor note on Piazza as soon as possible.

== How to Get Paid

Seminar TAs can submit up to 10 hours a week.
