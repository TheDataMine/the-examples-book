== TA Responsibility Overview

TAs are a key part of success in The Data Mine. Your constant support in seminars, grading, and office hours keeps the courses running smoothly. 

The Seminar TA position consists of *three* roles: Student-facing, Grader, or Hybrid TAs.

=== Student-facing TAs
Student-facing TAs are responsible for holding office hours and helping students with their projects.

=== Grader TAs
Grader TAs are responsible for grading student projects and providing feedback.

=== Hybrid TAs
Hybrid TAs are responsible for both student-facing and grading responsibilities. Next semester, only 301 TAs are hybrid.


All TAs should review the upcoming week's projects and solutions to be best prepared to assist students.

You can find a detailed calendar for next semester's weekly project schedule link:https://app.box.com/s/njk0g47rjxmw5bzig0k2mmspnmmencnf[here].

Seminar TAs are required to submit their hours to link:https://one.purdue.edu/launch-task/all/successfactors-employee?roles=[SuccessFactor] by *Sunday evenings at 11:59 PM.* 

== Monday Seminar

Each Monday Dr. Ward hosts seminar sessions for all students in the Data Mine to attend. These sessions are held in Hillenbrand Dining Court's atrium. 

The seminar times for Fall 2023 are:

- 8:30-9:30 AM
- 9:30-10:30 AM
- 10:30 -11:30 AM
- 4:30-5:30 PM (Virtual)

For the first 4 weeks of the semester, we need a few TAs (at least *four* for 101, *two* for 201, and *one* for 301) in each of the seminar times.

[NOTE]
====
Attending seminar counts towards your required office hours.
====

== Office Hours 

**Graders can skip over the office hours section and go to the xref:grading.adoc[Grading] section.**

TAs will choose their office hour times and will be expected to hold their scheduled office hours consistently each week.

We definitely need lots of help on Thursday and Friday. Evenings are much appreciated because we have students all over the world who will need help. Friday evenings are prime time, and we permit more than one TA working at a time then.

Please keep track of how many students come to each of your office hours during the first 3 weeks of the semester. We will reshuffle a bit based on popular times after the first 4 weeks, if needed.

- **Office hours _before_ 5:00 PM EST:** Hillenbrand Hall Lobby C100 
- **Office hours _after_ 5:00 PM EST:** Online in Zoom +
- **Office hours on the _weekend_:** Online in Zoom

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Your online Zoom meeting room should always be ON during in-person office hours**

The staff will randomly join office hour meetings to make sure this is being followed.
====

=== Set up your Zoom meeting room
All TAs should use their official Purdue Zoom meeting room to hold your office hours. Go to https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/ and log in with your Purdue credentials to setup your account. 

Please share the link for your Personal Zoom meeting room *link:https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/kabrap_purdue_edu/ERBOmLOevitBqUq6y2Ghx4gBxf3iFlXNyol2A6SNOhKgHQ?e=RkNxTL[here].*

=== Choose your time
When choosing your office hour time slot(s), please consider your own schedule and conflicts such as classes.

We encourage all TAs to hold office hours that impact the most students - you should aim to help as many students as you can. 

*Your help during office hours could change a student's day, week, month, or semester!* 

On *August 17*, you will be sent another email in which you will find a link to a spreadsheet to choose your weekly office hours time.

=== Unable to host office hours
If for a certain day you are unable to hold office hours, please post an instructor note in Piazza at least *48 hours before* to all the students and message the Head TA on Teams. 

If it is an *emergency* and you are unable to do the above in time, please post a instructor note and message the Head TA on Teams as soon as you can.

== How to Get Paid

Seminar TAs can submit up to 10 hours a week. 

[CAUTION]
====
International students can work a maximum 20 hours across all jobs.
