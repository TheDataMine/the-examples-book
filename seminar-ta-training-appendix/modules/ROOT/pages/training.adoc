== How to Get Paid

Seminar TAs can submit up to 10 hours a week. 

[CAUTION]
====
International students can only have 20 hours of paid work across all jobs.
====


Seminar TAs are required to submit their hours to link:https://one.purdue.edu/launch-task/all/successfactors-employee?roles=[SuccessFactor] by *Sunday evenings at 11:59 PM.* 

== Office Hours 
TAs will choose their office hour times and will be expected to hold their scheduled office hours consistently in person.

[NOTE]
====
Attending seminar counts towards your required office hours.
====

For the first 3 weeks of the semester, we need a few TAs (at least *four* for 101, *two* for 201, and *one* for 301) in each of the seminar times and in the hour after each seminar. We definitely need lots of help on Thursday and Friday. Evenings are much appreciated because we have students all over the world who will need help. Friday evenings are prime time, and we may permit more than one TA working at a time then.

Please keep track of how many students come to each of your office hours during the first 3 weeks of the semester. We will reshuffle a bit based on popular times after the first 3 weeks.

[NOTE]
====
**Office hours _during_ seminar:** Hillenbrand C141 -- the atrium inside the dining court +
**Office hours _outside_ of seminar, before 5:00 PM EST:** Hillenbrand Lobby C100 -- the lobby between the 2 sets of front entrances (Online Zoom meeting room should ON) +
**Office hours _after_ 5:00 PM EST:** Online in Zoom +
**Office hours on the _weekend_:** Online in Zoom
