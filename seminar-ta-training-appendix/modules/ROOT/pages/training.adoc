== TA Responsibility Overview

TAs are a key part of success in The Data Mine. Your constant support keeps the courses running smoothly. 

For the academic year 2025-2026, there will be a teams structure; Most TAs will be on a team that has specific tasks in areas of grading, online help (Piazza), and office hours. 

=== Office Hour TAs
Student-facing TAs are responsible for holding office hours and helping students with their projects and for spending time on Piazza answering student questions and providing feedback.

=== Grader TAs
Grader TAs are responsible for grading student projects and providing feedback.

=== Hybrid TAs
Hybrid TAs are responsible for both student-facing and grading responsibilities.  They may be on multiple teams or have a more hybrid job description.   


All TAs should review the upcoming week's projects and solutions to be best prepared to assist students.

Calendar is availble on the syllabus page for the courses.

TAs will work with staff to choose office hour times and will be expected to hold their scheduled office hours consistently each week.

We need lots of help on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Evenings are much appreciated because we have students all over the world who will need help. Wednesday evenings are prime time, and we permit more than one TA to work at a time.

These changes should be minimal and only if completely necessary to avoid confusion for the students.
