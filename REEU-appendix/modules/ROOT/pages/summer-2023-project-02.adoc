= REEU: Project Day 2 -- 2023

== How many crews include George Lucas in the role of `director`?



== How many shows have more than 10000 episodes?  Hint:  Use the `episodes` table, and `GROUP BY` the `show_title_id` and use the condition `HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000` at the end of the query.


== What are the 3 most popular episodes of Friends?  Please include the title of each episode.  Please verify your answer by double-checking with IMDB.

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!)

Hint:  Friends has `show_title_id = tt0108778`.

Another hint:  When you join the `episodes` table and the `ratings` table, you might want to add the condition `e.episode_title_id = r.title_id`

Another hint:  You might want to have `ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 3` at the end of your query, so that you are ordering the results by the ratings, and putting them in descending order (with the biggest at the top).


== Identify the 6 movies that have rating 9 or higher and have 50000 or more votes.


== For how many movies has Sean Connery been on the `crew`?


== Revisiting the question about George Lucas:  What are the titles of the movies in which George Lucas had the role of `director`?


== Revisiting the question about the shows that have more than 10000 episodes, please find the `primary_title` of these shows.



== Revisiting the question about how many movies has Sean Connery been on the `crew`:  Which movie is his most popular movie?


== Again revisiting the previous question about the popularity of movies for which Sean Connery has been on the `crew`:  Which movie is his most popular movie, if we limit our query to results with 1000 or more votes?  What is the title of the most popular result?

(For this question, use `rating` for popularity, i.e., please focus on high `rating` values.)
