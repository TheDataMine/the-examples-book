= Setting Up Accounts for The Data Mine

== 

== Creating an ACCESS account (for the first time)

Students need to create an account on the https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil high performance computing cluster].

The starting point for setting up an account is https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user

Dr Ward strongly suggests that you use the Firefox browser on a computer (instead of Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).

This video will walk you through the required steps to create your account:

== If you already have an ACCESS account BUT you forgot the ACCESS username

https://identity.access-ci.org/username-reminder

You provide the email address that you used, when you setup your ACCESS account, and they will send you a reminder about your ACCESS username.

== Share your username with The Data Mine team

This year we have a new process for sharing your username with The Data Mine team.  You log in here:

https://hub.datamine.purdue.edu/

Please use your Purdue email address when logging in.  If you are a non-Purdue student, please use the email address that you already provided to Jessica Jud.

Either way, when you log in to: https://hub.datamine.purdue.edu/

you should see a message on the webpage stating that:

"If your email is in our system and associated with an account, you will receive instructions for logging in shortly."

Check your email account to get the instructions for logging in.

This video will walk you through an example of these steps:

If you have difficulties with this process, please submit your questions here to The Data Mine:

https://service.purdue.edu/TDClient/32/Purdue/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=2PmJrZczzq4_&RequestorType=ServiceOffering&SIDs=35

If you are unable to submit a ticket via the portal above, or if you do not have a Purdue account, you can email us at: datamine-help@purdue.edu

== Setup two-factor authentication for logging in

To setup the two-factor authentication on your phone, log in to the ACCESS portal for the first time, using the username that you were just assigned, and the password that you selected, at this URL:  https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu

and click the "Login" button.  Please use your ACCESS username and password, not your Purdue username or password.

This video will walk you through the required steps to setup your two-factor authentication:

After you log-in with your two-factor authentication, please choose "Datamine Notebook" as the Server Option.

MARK, PUT A SCREENSHOT THERE!

The sessions at Purdue will be hands-on and immersive.  Students will benefit from having a laptop to type on, rather than (say) an Apple iPad or Galaxy Tablet.  The laptop does not need to be new or fancy.  The laptop simply enables students to login to the high performance computing cluster that students will use throughout the sessions.

Thanks for considering!

Our team at The Data Mine looks forward to working with students again this year!
