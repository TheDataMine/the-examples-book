= Setting Up Accounts for The Data Mine

Welcome to The Data Mine! You must follow the steps below to create accounts on the Anvil supercomputer.

Some NOTES before you start:

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you already completed these steps in the fall of 2025 for a seminar or corporate partners course you do not need to repeat them again!
====

[NOTE]
====
Everyone who will work on seminar and/or corporate partner projects, including all students, TAs, and mentors that choose to, must complete **all of the steps** outlined below. These steps are necessary to create accounts on the Anvil supercomputer and grant you access to shared directories for corporate partner projects.
====



Please follow these four steps carefully. If you have trouble at any point, you can jump to the <<get-help, help section>> at the bottom of this page. We suggest you use the https://www.firefox.com[Firefox] browser on a laptop or desktop for all steps.

[[step-1-create-access]]
== Step 1: Create an ACCESS Account

First, you need to create ACCESS accounts. ACCESS is a program funded by the National Science Foundation to provide a platform for researchers around the country to access supercomputers. It is used by The Data Mine to provide access to the Anvil supercomputer.

*   If you already have an ACCESS account, you do *not* need to create a new one. You can go to <<step-2-join-hub, Step 2>>.
*   If you forgot your ACCESS username, you can find it here: https://identity.access-ci.org/username-reminder

To create a new ACCESS account, go to this website: https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user-direct

[NOTE]
====
Please use your institutional email address when creating your ACCESS account rather than using your gmail or some other personal email.  Some universities have multiple valid email addresses for the same person (eg. person@cs.myuniv.edu and person@myuniv.edu). If that is the case for you, you must use the same email address when registering your ACCESS account that was used to send you your TDM Hub invitation.  Please provide all the required information in your profile. If any information is missing, we will be unable to create your accounts on the Anvil supercomputer.

**Institution or organization** (Purdue students should select "Purdue University".  Those at other universities or corporate partner institutions should select their respective university/institution from the dropdown menu. If you cannot find your organization in the list, you can request that it be added on the same page. The email address you provided must be associated with the institution you select or you will not be able to create an ACCESS account.)

**Academic status** +
**Current country of residence** +
**Citizenship** 
====

Be sure to record the ACCESS username and password you create. You will need the ACCESS username in step 2.

[[step-2-join-hub]]
== Step 2: Accept the The Data Mine Hub (TDM Hub) Invitation

Next, you must provide your ACCESS account name at The Data Mine Hub (TDM Hub) website.

. *You will receive an invitation email*
+
Check your university email for a message from `no-reply@purdue.edu`. The subject will be "Purdue Data Mine account creation invitation". This email has a unique personal link for you to join the TDM Hub (do not share it to others).
+
--
*_What if I do not get an email?_*

First, check your spam or junk folder. If you are at Purdue, try checking the https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine[Quarantine] as well. 

- *Mentors:* Some mentors may choose not to create Anvil accounts. If you do want Anvil accounts, the invitation will have been sent to the email address you gave to The Data Mine staff. If you have still not received the email, please contact your project liaison or submit a ticket by emailing datamine-help@purdue.edu.

-   *Purdue students:* Will receive their invitation usually one day after registering for a TDM course. If it has been two days since you registered and you still have not seen an invitation, please submit a ticket using the "The Data Mine Request" button on our https://service.purdue.edu/TDClient/32/Purdue/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=169[Ticketing] page.

-   *Non-Purdue students:* If you have still not received the invitation email, please submit a ticket by emailing datamine-help@purdue.edu.
--

. *Accept the Invitation*
+
Click the link in the email. If you have issues, try to copy and paste the link into a recently updated Firefox browser (private window, if necessary). A web page will open. Click the button to accept the invitation.
+
. *Complete Your Checklist*
+
Inside the TDM Hub, you will see an Account Setup Checklist. You must complete all the required items. The page updates automatically as you complete the steps.  Note that the ACCESS Allocation step will take up to four hours to complete.

If you are interrupted when completing these steps and need to resume this process later, you can return to the TDM Hub at any time by browsing to https://hub.datamine.purdue.edu/ and clicking the "Log in to get started" button, which will prompt you to enter the same email address that was used to send your invitation.

[[step-3-setup-mfa]]
== Step 3: Set Up Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

ACCESS requires all users to add Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for their accounts which uses the Duo Mobile app on your smartphone or tablet to provide a second form of authentication in addition to your ACCESS password.

. Go to the Anvil login page: https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu
. Click the "Login" button.
. Use your *ACCESS username and password* (not your Purdue username and password).

The website will show you how to set up MFA with the Duo Mobile app on your phone.

[[step-4-login-anvil]]
== Step 4: Log In to Anvil and Start a Server

After you have completed your TDM Hub enrollment and added your ACCESS username, it will take on the order of four hours for your Anvil account to be created. When completed, you can try to log in to Anvil for the first time by browsing to:

https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu/


When you log in, you will see "Server Options". Please only choose **Datamine Notebook**.  The other options will not have the right versions of python, R, and associated packages installed.

You will do your work with Anvil through a browser on a desktop or laptop computer. A tablet (like an iPad or Galaxy Tab) will not work as well. Your computer does not need to be new or powerful. It just needs a modern web browser, preferably Firefox.
