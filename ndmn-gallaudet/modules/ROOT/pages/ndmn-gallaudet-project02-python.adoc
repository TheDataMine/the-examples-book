**Motivation:** In Python it is very important to understand some of the data types more depth than you would in R. Many of the data types in Python will seem very familiar. +


[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*R* |*Python*

|character |string 'str'

|integer | integer 'int'
|numeric | float

|logical | boolen 'bool'
|===


In addition to all of that, there are other classifications that  the packages in Python include. The most popular packages are `pandas` and `numpy`. +
Things like `tuple`s, `list`s, `set`s, and `dict`s that diverge from R. +
It is important to understand basic concepts in Python before jumping in.

**Context:** This is the second project introducing some basic data types, and demonstrating some familiar control flow concepts, all while digging right into a dataset.

**Scope:** tuples, lists, if statements, opening files

.Learning Objectives
****

- List the differences between lists & tuples and when to use each.
- Gain familiarity with string methods, list methods, and tuple methods.
- Demonstrate the ability to read and write data of various formats using various packages.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

#### Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset found in Anvil:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv`

== Questions

==== ONE

Read in the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv` into a `pandas` DataFrame called `myDF`.

====
`pandas` is an integral tool for various data science tasks in Python. You can read a quick intro https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html[here].+
We will be slowly introducing bits and pieces of this package throughout the semester.

==== TWO

Using the function https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dataframe-attributes-in-python-pandas/[attributes] to get the number of columns and rows of our dataset. How many columns and rows are there? Use f-stringsfootnote:[an improved way to format strings. Less prone to errors, faster, easier to read,  and more concise] to print a message, for example

There are 123 columns in the DataFrame +
There are 321 rows in the DataFrame!

Attributes are the different properties of a data.frame that can be used to get data/information from a particular data.frame

* index- _index()_there are two types of index in a data.frame. One being row index and the other colummn index. 
[source,python]
----
mydf.index
----

* columns- can be used ot get the label values for the columns in the dataset
[source,python]
----
mydf.columns
----

* axes- used when we want to know the value of all row labels AND column labels at the same time
[source, python]
----
mydf.axes
----

* d(ata)types- used to show the data types for each column in the data.frame
[source,python]
----
mydf.dtypes
----
* size- used to show the total number of elements/items in a data.frame
[source, python]
----
mydf.size
----
* shape- show the total number of rows and columns of a specific data.frame
[source,python]
----
mydf.shape
----
* ndim- stands for number of dimensions, this shows the number of dimensions in a specific data.frame
[source,python]
----
mydf.ndim
----
* empty- this checks to see if the data.frame is empty, if it is indeed empty it will retun TRUE but if the data.frame has elements/information then it will return FALSE
[source,python]
----
mydf.empty
----
* T- stands for _transpose_ this means that you can change rows into columns and also vice versa of columns into rows. 
[source,python]
----
mydf.T
----
* values- returns a view object which contains the values of the _dic_ as a list. 
[source,python]
----
mydf.values
----

.Helpful Hint

Earlier we learned how to read a csv file into `python`, line-by-line, and print values. +
Use the `csv` package to print _just_ the first row, which should contain the names of the columns, OR instead of using the `csv` package, use one of the `pandas` attributes from `myDF` to print the column names.

==== THREE

* Using the `pandas` package get a list called `our_columns` that contains the column names. +
* Print the second value in the list. +
* Without using a loop, print the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. elements of the list. +
* Print the last four elements of the list ( "state", "lat", "long") by accessing their negative index.

[loweralpha]
.. `*matplotlib*` is one of the primary plotting packages in Python. Use the following code 

[source, python]
----
my_values = tuple(myDF.loc[:, 'odometer'].dropna().to_list())
----
Using the result which is a _tuple_ create a lineplot of odometer readings.

A tuple is used to store multiple items in a single variable. One of four data types that Python uses to store collections of data. The other three include *List, Set, Dictionary* 

*Tuple*  a collection of data separated by commas which is ordered and cannot be changed (aka immutable). A tuple *does* allow for duplicate values, can be any data type +
*List*  data structure that is changable (aka mutable). Each element/value is inside the list is an item. A list *does* allow for duplicate values, and can be any data type +
*Set*  is an unordered collection of items. Each element is unique which means that there are *no duplicates* and cannot be changed (aka immutable). Elements/items cannot be accessed by using indexes because a set is unordered. Can be constructed with any data type +
*Dictionary* it is a data structure that is also known as an _associative array_ it is a colletion of key-value pairs. They are ordered, and changable (aka mutable) and do *not* allow for duplicates. values can be any data type. 
====

The linelot is not informative, and if we tried to sort the values we are unable to do that because a _tuple_ is immutable.  A good article about this http://www.compciv.org/guides/python/fundamentals/tuples-immutable/[here]. In addition, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708510/list-vs-tuple-when-to-use-each[this] is a great post will help you understand when using a tuple would be benifical. +

["loweralpha", start=2]
.. Knowing that now that lists _are_ mutable, so they can be sorted.  Convert `my_values` to a list and then sort, and re-plot.
+
Notice that there are potential ouliers in your data that are making the plot looking askew. We can use negative indexing to plot the sorted values. We want to remove the last 50 values (which are the highest values). 

.Helpful Hint
[%collapsible]
====
To prevent plotting values on the same plot use the `close` method.
[source, python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
my_values = [1,2,3,4,5]
plt.plot(my_values)
plt.show()
plt.close()

So far we have summarized some data and created a graph using `matplotlib`, we have used `pandas` to find interesting facts about our dataset, and highlighted the differences between *lists and tuples*. Onto the next!
