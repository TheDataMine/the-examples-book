= TDM 10100: Project 8 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Functions are an important part of writing efficient code. +
Functions allow us to repeat and reuse code. If you find you using a set of coding steps over and over, a function may be a good way to reduce your lines of code!

**Context:** We've been learning about and using functions these last few weeks. +
To learn how to write your own functions we need to learn some of the terminology and components.  

**Scope:** r, functions

.Learning Objectives
****
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the following functions to solve data-driven problem(s): mean, var, table, cut, paste, rep, seq, sort, order, length, unique, etc.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Comprehend what a function is, and the components of a function in R.
****

== Dataset(s)

We will use the same dataset(s) as last week:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/titles.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/episodes.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/people.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/ratings.csv`

.Helpful Hints
[%collapsible]
====
`fread`- is a fast and efficient way to read in data.

[source,r]
----
library(data.table)

titles <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/titles.csv"))
episodes <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/episodes.csv"))
people <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/people.csv"))
ratings <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/ratings.csv"))

== Questions

Writing our own function to make a repetitive operation easier by turning it into a single command. +

Take care to name the function something concise but meaningful so that others can understand what the function can be understood by other users. +

Function parameters can also be called formal arguments. 

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
A function is an object that contains multiple interrelated statements put together in a predefined order when called(run). +

Functions can be built-in or created by the user (user-defined). +

.Some examples of built in functions are: 

* min(), max(), mean(), median()
* print()
* head()

Syntax of a function

----
what_you_name_the_function <- function (parameters) {
  statement(s) that are executed when the function runs
  the last line of the function is the returned value
}

To gain a better insight into our data, let's make two simple plots:

[loweralpha]
.. A grouped bar chart https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/bar.html[see an example here]
.. A line plot http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/line-plots-r-base-graphs[see an example here]
.. What information are you gaining from either of these graphs?

For practice, now that you have a basic understanding of how to make a function, we will use that knowledge, applied to our dataset.

Here are pieces of a function we will use on this dataset; put them in the correct order +

* results <- merge(ratings_df, titles_df, by.x = "title_id", by.y = "title_id")
* }
* function(titles_df, ratings_df, ratings_of_at_least)
* return(popular_movie_results)
* {
* popular_movie_results <- results[results$type == "movie" & results$rating >= ratings_of_at_least, ]
* find_movie_with_at_least_rating <-

Take the above function and add comments explaining what the function does at each step.

Using the code above answer these questions.

[loweralpha]
.. How many movies in total are there, which are above that limit?
.. Change the limits in the function from "at least 5.0" to "lower than 5.0".
.. How many movies have ratings lower than 5.0?

Now create a function that takes a genre as the input and finds either
[loweralpha]
.. the movie from that genre that has the largest number of votes, OR
.. the movie from that genre that has the highest rating.

(You don't need to do both.  In the video, I discuss how to find the movie from that genre that has the highest rating.)
