= TDM 30100: Project 12 -- 2022

**Motivation:** RESTful APIs are everywhere! At some point in time, it will likely be the source of some data that you will want to use. What better way to understand how to interact with APIs than building your own?

**Context:** This is the second to last project in a series around APIs. In this project, we will build a minimal API that does some basic operations, and in the following project we will build on top of that API and use _templates_ to build a "frontend" for our API.

**Scope:** Python, fastapi, VSCode

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand and use the HTTP methods with the `requests` library.
- Differentiate between graphql, REST APIs, and gRPC.
- Write REST APIs using the `fastapi` library to deliver data and functionality to a client.
- Identify the various components of a URL. 
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

In addition, the following is an illustration of the database to help you understand the data.

For this project, we will be using the imdb sqlite database. This database contains the data in the directory listed above.

== Questions

=== Question 1

Let's start by setting up our API, and getting a few things configured. This project will assume that you were able to connect and setup VSCode in the previous project. If you didn't do this, please go back and do that now. That project (aside from some initially incorrect windows commands) is pretty straightforward and at the end you have a super cool setup and easy way to work on Anvil using VSCode!

. Open VSCode and connect to Anvil.
. Hold Cmd+Shift+P (or Ctrl+Shift+P) to open the command palette, search for "Terminal: Create new terminal" and hit enter. This will open a terminal in VSCode that is connected to Anvil.
. Copy over our project template into your `$HOME` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -r /anvil/projects/tdm/etc/imdb $HOME
----
+
. Open the `$HOME/imdb` directory in VSCode.
. Load up our `f2022-s2023` Python environment by running the following in the terminal in VSCode.
+
[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
module load python/f2022-s2023
----
+
. Go ahead and test out the provided, minimal API by running the following in the terminal in VSCode.
+
[source,bash]
----
find_port # returns a port, like 7777
----
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m uvicorn imdb.api:app --reload --port 7777 # replace 7777 with the port you got from find_port
----
+
. Open a browser on your computer and navigate to `localhost:7777`, but be sure to replace 7777 with the port you got from `find_port`. You should see a message that says "Hello World!". This is a JSON response, which is why your browser is showing it in a nice format.

No need to turn anything in for this question -- it is integral for all of the remaining questions.

=== Question 2

If you check out `api.py` you will find two functions. The `root` function is responsible for the "Hello World" message you received in the previous question. As you can see, we returned the JSON response, which caused the data to be rendered that way. JSON is a data format that is _very_ common in RESTful APIs. For simiplicity, we will be using JSON for all of our responses, today.

The other function, `read_item`, is responsible for the "hi there" stuff from the previous project. If you navigate to `localhost:7777/hithere/alice` you will see a webpage that displays the name "alice". The url path parameter `{name}` turns into a variable. So if you changed `alice` to `joe`, you would see "hi there joe" instead. This is a very common pattern in RESTful APIs.

We are going to keep things as "simple" as possible, because there are so many components to this sort of project that it is easy to get confused and have something go wrong. Our goal is to wire our API up to the database, `imdb.db`, and create an endpoint that returns some structured data (as JSON). 

It is _highly_ recommended to go through the https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/[official documentation tour]. It is well written and may provide examples that help you understand something we do for this project, better.

Let's start with our problem statement. We want links like the following to display data about the given title: `localhost:7777/title/tt8946378`. Where `tt8946378` is the imdb.com title id for "Knives Out". Specifically, we want to start by displaying the: `primary_title`, `premiered`, and `runtime_minutes` from the `titles` table.

Before we can even think about displaying the data, we need to wire up our database. Create a new file in the `imdb` directory called `database.py`. Include the following content.

[source,python]
----
import os
import aiosql
import sqlite3
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path

load_dotenv()

database_path = Path(os.getenv("DATABASE_PATH"))
queries = aiosql.from_path(Path(__file__).parents[0] / "queries.sql", "sqlite3")
----

We are going to use the https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/[`aiosql`] package to make queries to our database. This package is extremely simple (compared to other packages) and has (in my opinion) the best separation of SQL and Python code. It is also very easy to use (compared to other packages, at least). Let's walk through the code.

. `load_dotenv()` load the environment variables from a `.env` file. Classically, the `.env` file is used to store sensitive credentials, like database passwords. In our case, our database has no password, so to demonstrate we are going to put our database path in an environment variable instead. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
We haven't created a `.env` file yet, let's do that now! Create a text file named `.env` in your root directory (the outer `imdb` folder) and add the following contents:

.env
----
DATABASE_PATH=/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

Now, after `load_dotenv()` is called, the `os.getenv("DATABASE_PATH")` will return the path to our database, `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`.
====
+
. `database_path` is simply the path loaded into a variable.
. `queries` is an object that load up all of our SQL queries from a future `queries.sql` file, and allows us to easily make SQL queries from inside Python. We will give example of this later.

That's it! We can then import the `queries` object in our other Python modules in order to make queries, cool!

No need to submit anything for this question either. The `database.py` file will be submitted at the end.

=== Question 3

Okay, we "wired" our database up, but we need to actually make a query that returns all of the information we want to display, right?

Create a new file called `queries.sql` in the inner `imdb` directory. This file will contain all of our SQL queries. The "comments" inside this file are critical for our `aiosql` package to identify the queries and load them into our `queries` object. The following is an example of a `queries.sql` file and Python code that uses it to make queries on a fake database.

.queries.sql
----
-- name: get_name_and_age
-- Get name and age of object.
SELECT name, age FROM my_table WHERE myid = :myid;
----

[source,python]
----
conn = sqlite3.connect("fake.db")
queries = aiosql.from_path("queries.sql", "sqlite3")
results = queries.get_name(conn, myid=1)
conn.close()
print(results)

# or, the following, which automatically closes the connection

queries = aiosql.from_path("queries.sql", "sqlite3")
conn = sqlite3.connect("fake.db")
with conn as c:
    results = queries.get_name(c, myid=1)

print(results)
----

.output
----
[("bob", 42), ("alice", 37)]
----

Add a query called `get_title` to your `queries.sql` file. This query should return the `primary_title`, `premiered`, and `runtime_minutes` from the `titles` table.

In your `api.py` file, add a new function that will be used to eventually return a JSON with the title information. Call this function `get_title`.

For now, just use the `queries` object to make a query to the database, and have the function return whatever the query returns. Once implemented, test it out by navigating to `localhost:7777/title/tt8946378` in your browser. You should see a (incorrectly) rendered response, with the info we wanted to display. We are getting there!

For this question, include a screenshot like the following, but for a different title.

[NOTE]
====
If you use Chrome, your screenshot may look a bit different, that is OK.
====

[TIP]
====
The `read_item` is very similar, just more complicated than our `get_title` function. You can use it as a reference.

=== Question 4

Okay! We were able to display our data, but it is not formatted correctly, and without any context, it is hard to say what 130 represents (runtime in minutes). Let's fix that by using the `pydantic` package to create a `Title` model. This model will be used to format our data before it is returned to the user. It is good practice to have all _responses_ be formatted using `pydantic` -- that way data is always returned in a consistent, expected format.

Read https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/?h=pydantic#create-pydantic-models-schemas-for-reading-returning[this] section of the official documentation.

Create a new file called `schemas.py` in the `imdb` directory. In this file, create a `Title` model that has all of the fields we want to display.

In your `api.py` file, update your `get_title` function to return a `Title` object instead of the raw data from the database.

[TIP]
====
To take a query result and convert it to a `pydantic` model, do the following (for example).

[source,python]
----
queries = aiosql.from_path("queries.sql", "sqlite3")
conn = sqlite3.connect("fake.db")
with conn as c:
    results = queries.get_name(c, myid=1)

results = {key: result[0][i] for i, key in enumerate(MyModel.__fields__.keys())}
my_model = MyModel(**results)
----
====

Navigate to `localhost:7777/title/tt8946378` in your browser. You should see a correctly formatted response, with the info we wanted to display. Your result should look like the following image, but for a different title.

image::figure38.webp[Example output, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Example output"]

Please submit the following things for this project.

- A `.ipynb` file with a screenshot for question 3 and 4 added.
- Your `api.py` file.
- Your `database.py` file.
- Your `queries.sql` file.
- Your `schemas.py` file.

Congratulations! You should feel accomplished! While it may not _feel_ like you did much, you wired together a database and backend API, made SQL queries from within Python, and formatted your data using `pydantic` models. That is a lot of work! Great job! Happy thanksgiving!
