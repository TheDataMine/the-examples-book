Projects are **released on Mondays**, and are due 1 week and 2 days later on the following **Wednesday, by 11:59pm**.  **There are a few exceptions to these dates; please refer to the schedule.**  Late work is **not** accepted. We give partial credit for work you have completed -- **always** submit the work you have completed before the due date. If you do _not_ submit the work you were able to get done, we will _not_ be able to give you credit for the work you were able to complete.

**Always** double check that the work that you submitted was uploaded properly. See xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here] for more information.

Each week, we will announce in Piazza that a project is officially released. Some projects, or parts of projects may be released in advance of the official release date. **Work on projects ahead of time at your own risk.**  These projects are subject to change until the official release announcement in Piazza.
