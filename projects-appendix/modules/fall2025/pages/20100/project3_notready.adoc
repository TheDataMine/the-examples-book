= TDM 20100: Project 3 - `grep`

== Project Objectives

This project introduces you to `grep`, one of the most powerful and widely used tools in UNIX for searching and filtering text. Through hands-on practice, you’ll learn how to combine `grep` with other common command-line utilities like `wc`, `cut`, `tr`, `uniq`, and `sort` to extract and analyze information within your Jupyter notebook environment.

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use grep to search text patterns across one or multiple files
- Apply flags like `-i`, `-n`, `-c`, `-E`, and `-v` to modify search behavior
- Use regular expressions (regex) to match advanced search patterns
- Combine commands using pipes (`|`) to build multi-step workflows
- Filter and transform data using tools like `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and `tr`
- Work with wildcard patterns (`*`) to search across files and directories
- Analyze data using command-line tools for quick insight

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
`grep` is a Bash command that returns lines containing the given pattern. It’s a useful command! By default, matching is case-sensitive, but you can add `-i` to make it case-insensitive. A pattern can be as simple as a plain word or as complex as a regular expression (regex). You need to add `-E` to interpret the given pattern as a regular expression—otherwise, the command treats it as a literal string. It is worth to note that a literal string is a sequence of characters treated as themselves, while a regular expression is a pattern that can match a variety of strings.

. Go to `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/`
. Search for all lines in `tracks.csv` containing "Little Mix"
. Find who sang the song "Waiting for Blue"
. Count how many lines contain "Michael Jackson" using the `-c` option
. Count how many lines contain "X Marks the Pedwalk" (hint: use `-i`)
. Which line in the file contains "Rainbow in the Night"? (hint: use `-n`)
. Find all lines containing "garlic" (case insensitive)
. Find all lines where "garlic" appears as a whole word
. Count how many lines contain "garlic" as a substring, but not as a whole word

=== Question 2 (2 points)
The `grep` command isn't limited to a single file—you can search multiple files, or even entire directories, using wildcards like `*`.

Suppose you want to search all files ending with `.txt`. You can do this by entering `/matcha/\*.txt`, which searches all `.txt` files in the `matcha` folder. If you want to search only files starting with "fli", enter `/matcha/fli*`, which searches all files that begin with "fli" in the `matcha` folder.

Let’s try it for ourselves!

. Go to `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/`
. Using `-c`, find how many lines in each `.csv` file contain "apple" (case-insensitive)
. If you try to run a `grep` command on `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/*`, it will print an error for all inner directories. Try it! What `-OPTION` can you add to make the command work?
. Now run the `grep` command on `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/*` with all the appropriate options, using "pointer" (case-insensitive) as the search pattern

=== Question 3 (2 points)
A pipeline (`|`) allows you to run multiple commands in sequence, passing the output of one command as input to the next.

. Similar to Question 1.4, find how many lines contain "Michael Jackson" using `wc` instead of the `-c` option
. Repeat Question 1.5: find how many lines contain "X Marks the Pedwalk" using `wc` instead of `-c`
. Print the head of `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/Reviews.csv`, displaying only the `ProfileName`, `Score`, and `Summary` columns
(Hint: use `cut` to split a line by a delimiter and select specific fields)
. Print the head of `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/music.txt`, replacing all whitespaces with underscores (_) using the `tr` command
. From the first 76 lines of `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/Reviews.csv`, search for lines containing "chocolate" (case-insensitive) and print only the `ProductId` column
(Hint: use three `|` in this pipeline)

=== Question 4 (2 points)
You can use `uniq` to count how many times each word or line occurs consecutively in a file. To do this, the input must be sorted first. You can also sort the output using the `sort` command.

. Stay in `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/`
. In the previous step, you found the ProductIds for the first 76 lines that contain "chocolate". Print unique ProductIds only.
. Count how many times each unique ProductId appears in that output.
. Sort the output from the previous step in descending order.
. For the entire file, find the count of each ProductId that appears on lines containing "chocolate", sort the counts in decreasing order, and print the first 10 lines of the final output.
(i.e., the 10 ProductIds most frequently associated with "chocolate")

=== Question 5 (2 points)
In the first question, regular expressions (regex) were briefly mentioned. Regex is a powerful tool that allows for flexible and complex string pattern matching. For example, instead of performing two separate searches for "grey" and "gray," a single regex search using the pattern `gr(e|a)y` can match both variations. The rules for regex can be challenging to memorize (and that’s okay—they’re not required).

If you're interested in learning more about regex, https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/regular-expressions-cookbook/9781449327453/[The Regular Expressions Cookbook by Jan Goyvaerts and Steven Levithan] is a great place to start - and it’s free with your Purdue account!

 The main goal for this question is to learn how to look up specific syntax and use it effectively. Regular expressions can get quite complex, but let’s start with some simple examples.

. Stay in `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/amazon/`
. Use a regular expression to find the number of lines containing either "love" or "hate" (case-insensitive)
. Print all lines that begin with a capital letter (Hint: `^`)
. In the head, print the lines that begin with a capital letter in the `Summary` column
. Count lines for the whole file that begin with a capital letter in the `Summary` column
. In the `Summary` column, count lines that end with "great" (case-insensitive) (Hint: `$`)
. In the `Text` column, find how many reviews contain at least two digit numbers (Hint: `\d.*\d`)

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
