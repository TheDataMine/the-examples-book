= TDM 10100: Project 7 - Writing Functions

== Project Objectives
Motivation: Functions are an important part of programming. Sometimes it is useful to write your own functions to have an efficient tool to reuse.

Context: Functions, up to this point, have been pre-written for us. We will learn how to write them and begin writing some of our own. 

Scope: R, function, tapply, data cleaning

.Learning Objectives
****
- Write some functions

== Dataset
- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/most_subscribed_youtube_channels.csv
- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/spotify/taylor_swift_discography_updated.csv

### Youtube Channels
The Youtube platform was created to give everyone a chance to show their unique ideas to the world. It is fairly easy to post on Youtube, and is a user-friendly site to visit. That being said, there are accounts on Youtube that blow up in popularity. Currently, the most subscribed to account is MrBeast, with 418 million subscribers. An updated list can be found https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels[here]. 

Youtube has more than 2.7 billion monthly users, with more than 1 billion hours of content being played per day. The top content categories go from Comedy to Music to News & Politics. This dataset of the top 1000 Youtubers contains useful information about each Youtuber's channel and content.

This dataset was last updated 3 years ago, but the top 1000 Youtubers have not changed too much. There are 7 columns and 1000 rows of data. These columns include:

- `rank`: rank of the channel based on subscriber count
- `Youtuber`: official channel name
- `subscribers`: number of subscribers to each channel
- `video views`: collective number of videos watched per channel
- `video count`: number of videos uploaded by channel 
- `category`: genre of the channel's content
- `started`: year when the channel was started

### Taylor Swift Spotify
Taylor Swift has built a massive universe of storylines and lyrics since 2006, spreading across her 11 original studio albums and worldwide fanbase. Earning over $2 billion in revenue from the Eras Tour alone, there is a lot of data to be collected from Taylor Swift. Her most recent album, "The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology", with 31 tracks, was included in the most recent addition of this dataset. This is a huge album, but she has written hundreds of songs. Compiling data from Spotify about her collection alone allows for an interesting dataset to work with.

Some of these columns may seem strange, such as danceability, energy, liveness, speechiness, etc. These are some unique ways that Spotify tracks factors of songs, and allows for comparison of these traits across songs and artists. 

There are 28 columns and 577 rows in this dataset. Some of these columns include:

- `track_name`: name of the track
- `duration_ms`: the duration of track in milliseconds
- `spotify_streams`: number of streams on Spotify
- `album`: name of the album track appears on
- `track_lyrics`: lyrics of the track 
- `energy`: intensity and activity level of the track (0 to 1)

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
Read in the Youtube Channels dataset as `youtubers`.

This dataset contains a few columns of mainly character data about the top 1000 `youtubers` as of three years ago. 

The problem is, some columns we would expect to be numerical (such as `video.count`) have been entered as containing character data. But this is OK because we have dealt with problems like this before. Use `gsub()` and `as.numeric()` to make a new column containing the values from `video.count`, cleaned and converted to numbers. 

Now with this new column, we can use `tapply()` and find the total number of videos made within each category. Save this as `category_counts`. Go ahead and display its contents because, while we are going to plot this, some of the labels will get cut off, and having shown `category_counts` here will make a nice reference. 

Barplot `category_counts` and add a title, axis labels, `las` (turn the x-axis labels), and whatever other customizations you would like to see. 

Make a subset of `youtubers` that contains the entries where category is either `"Gaming"` or `"Music"`. From this subset, use `tapply()` again and get the total video counts for each `category` and `started` year.

[NOTE]
====
When you make a grouped barplot of this, make sure to include the `legend` to be able to distingish the values belonging to their respective categories. 
====

Use `tapply()` one more time and find the average video count for each `started` year. Make a `plot()` to show this. 

[HINT]
====
Read about `plot()` https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/plot[here]
====

.Deliverables
====
1.1 (Barplot) Which category had the most total videos?  +
1.2 (Grouped barplot) Which year that the Gaming channels started in went on to produce the most videos overall? +
1.3 What was the average video count for a channel made in 2008?
====

=== Question 2 (2 points) 
When there is a problem you want to solve or a task you want to automate, it can be useful to write a function. In a basic example, I could write a function that would take the input of a date and output how many days away it is from today. And I could continue to call the function and only have to change the date I inputted to get a new result. 

One basic function structure is:
[source,R]
----
name_to_save_as <- function(input_df , input2) {
  my_output <- input_df[input_df$example_col >= input2, ]
  return(my_output)
}
----

Read in the Taylor Swift dataset as `ts_songs` and view the `head()` and dimensions of the data. Make sure to use `read.csv2` here, because the Taylor Swift dataset is ';' (semi-colon) delimited (rather than comma). 

[NOTE]
====
Use `options(repr.matrix.max.cols=50, repr.matric.max.rows=200)` to change the maximum number of rows and columns you can view at once. 
====

[WARNING]
====
There is a column that shows every lyric for each song in the dataset. Use `ts_songs \<- ts_songs[ , !(names(ts_songs) %in% "track_lyrics")]` to not include it.
====

The `energy` column looks numeric, but is actually character data. To begin working with this data, convert `energy` to be numeric. 

[HINT]
====
In this case, there is no need to use `gsub()`, and just converting the data to numeric will do fine. 
====

Build a function `find_songs_with_energy` that follows along with our basic function structure. The purpose of this `find_songs_with_energy` is to take a dataframe and an energy threshold. Any song with an energy that is greater than or equal to the set energy threshold will get saved and returned. 

Test out your function using the `ts_songs` dataset, and the median value of the `energy` column. 

Build a second function `find_songs_by_album` that takes the input of a dataset, an album, and saves any songs that are from that album. Test this function using `"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology"`. Your result should have 31 rows. 

.Deliverables
====
2.1 What was the maximum energy level possible from the songs? What was the minimum? +
2.2 How many songs had high energy? +
2.3 Your function for finding songs by album, tested on "The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology".
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)
The `spotify_streams` column is also full of character data. Try making a new column containing the numeric `spotify_streams` values. 

[HINT]
====
Use `ts_songs[is.na(ts_songs$[your_new_column]) & !is.na(ts_songs$spotify_streams), "spotify_streams"]` to spot problematic values.
====

[NOTE] 
====
When using `gsub()`, there are some characters that require `"\\"` before them. Read more https://uc-r.github.io/regex[here].
====

Use your function `find_songs_by_album` to find all of the songs from the album `"evermore (deluxe version)"`. Save this as a separate dataframe.

Load the `ggplot2` library through `library(ggplot2)`.

`ggplot` allows for more customization and specific details when plotting. Read more at this very helpful site https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2.html[here].

Plot your `evermore` dataframe using `ggplot`. Your plot should include:

- `aes`: sets what the x- and y-axis should track
- `geom_bar`: should have `stat = "identity"` so the height of each bar corresponds to the values rather than number of occurences. You can also customize the bar fill colors here
- `theme`: `axis.text.x modifies` the labels along the x-axis. Use `angle = 45` and `hjust = 1` to nicely customize your element text
- `labs`: customize your title and axis labels.

.Deliverables
====
3.1 Why couldn't the spotify_streams column be immediately converted to numeric? +
3.2 How many songs were in "evermore (deluxe version)"? +
3.3 Plot from using ggplot on the evermore dataframe.
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)
Using the `find_songs_by_album` function, create a new dataframe `ts_1989` containing all of the songs from the    `"1989 (Taylor's Version) [Deluxe]"` album. There should be 22 songs. 

Looking at the duration column for these songs, the values are very strange. This column of the dataset is counting the length of songs in milliseconds. Make two new columns: 

- `duration_sec`: the values from `duration_ms` divided by 1000
- `duration_min`: the values from `duration_sec` divided by 60

Use `ggplot` to make a barplot of the tracks from `ts_1989` based on their time length in minutes. 

The labels for this plot are ugly, even after we've tilted and adjusted them. 
A big factor of this is the fact that each song title has `"(Taylor's Version)"` tacked on the end. It is best to make a new column that has the `"(Taylor's Version)"` removed from each song entry. 

[NOTE]
====
In your `gsub` line, remember to add `"\\"` before each parenthesis
====

Make another plot that takes the cleaned track names and their time length in minutes. It still isn't perfect, and you are welcome to remove each `"(From The Vault)"` or adjust things more, or anything else you would like to do to your plot, but this is all that is required.

.Deliverables
====
4.1 Why were the "\\" needed when cleaning the song names? +
4.2 What customizations did you use on your final plot?
====

=== Question 5 (2 points)
In the `youtubers` dataset, make a second subscribers column, this one cleaned and containing numeric data. 

If we wanted to find the most-subscribed-to Youtuber from this dataset, it would not be challenging. But something cool that comes from building functions is that they are reusable. We can build a function that takes a dataframe and a selected genre and returns a Youtuber. When using this function, we can switch out whatever dataframe or genre is used in the input, and get completely different outputs without having to write too much. 

In your function, you should take your inputted dataframe's `category` column and find all entries that are the same as the inputted genre. This will be called `genre_rows`.

In your `genre_rows`, use `which.max()` to find the entry in your numeric subscribers column which has the highest subscribers count. Return this result. 

To test this function, use the `youtubers` dataset and the `category` that is `"Gaming"`. The result should be PewDiePie, with 111,000,000 subscribers at whatever time this dataset was last updated. 

Look at the table of the `category` column from `youtubers` and choose another category to test this function on. 

.Deliverables
====
5.1 Function to find top-subscribed-to Youtubers +
5.2 What second category did you use? Which Youtuber was it? +
5.3 How does this dataset from 3 years ago relate to the current top Youtuber list?
