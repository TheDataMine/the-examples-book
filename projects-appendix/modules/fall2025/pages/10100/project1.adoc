= TDM 10100: R Project 1 -- Fall 2025

**Motivation:** Our goal in Project 1 is to help you get comfortable with aspects of The Data Mine.  We use Jupyter Lab on the Anvil computational cluster.  In this first project, it is OK to ask many questions and to explore!  (It is always OK to ask questions.)  The main goal is to get prepared to work in The Data Mine.  We are happy to have you join this experience.

**Context:** In The Data Mine, we do not require any background or prerequisites.  It is OK if this is your first time working with data.  No background is needed.  We aim to give practical examples and to always be "learning by doing."

**Scope:** Anvil, Jupyter Lab, R

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn how to work in Jupyter Lab
- Learn how to upload and download files to/from the Anvil computing cluster
- Read data using R
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/breyers/reviews.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/bj/products.csv`

First and foremost, welcome to The Data Mine! We hope that throughout your journey with us, you learn a lot, make new friends, and develop skills that will help you with your future career. Throughout your time with The Data Mine, you will have plenty of resources available should you need help. By coming to weekly seminar, posting on the class Piazza page, and joining Dr. Ward and the TA team's office hours, you can ensure that you always have the support you need to succeed in this course.

If you did not (yet) set up your 2-factor authentication credentials with Duo, you can set up the credentials here: https://the-examples-book.com/setup[https://the-examples-book.com/setup] If you are still having issues with your ACCESS ID, please send an email containing as much information as possible about your issue to datamine-help@purdue.edu
====

Let's start off by starting up our first Jupyter session on Anvil!  We always use the URL https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu[https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu] and the ACCESS username that you were assigned (when you setup your account) and the ACCESS password that you chose.  These are *NOT* the same as your Purdue account!  (If you are talking to someone who was in The Data Mine last year, this URL is also new for fall 2025!)

[IMPORTANT]
====
These credentials are not the same as your Purdue account.
====

In the upper-middle part of your screen, you should see a dropdown button labeled `The Data Mine`. Click on it, then select `seminar-r` from the Notebook options that appear. If you followed all the previous steps correctly, you should now be on a screen that looks like this:

image::f25-101-p1-1.png[Server Options for Jupyter Lab, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Server Options for Jupyter Lab"]

If your screen doesn't look like this, please try and select the correct dropdown option again or ask one of the TAs during seminar for more assistance.

There are a few key parts of this screen to note:

- You need to use *Datamine Notebook* (not the Anvil Notebook) for The Data Mine
- Resources: CPU cores do the computation for the programs we run.  It may be tempting to request a large number of CPU cores and RAM, and set it to the maximum, but our computing cluster is a shared resource.  This means every computational core that you use is one that someone else can't use.  We only have a limited number of cores assigned to our team, so please *ONLY* reserve 2 Cores and 4GB RAM, unless the project needs more cores.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Jupyter Lab environment will save your work at regular intervals, so that at the end of a session, your work should be automatically saved.  Nonetheless, you can select File from the menu and Save Notebook any time that you want.  (It is not necessarily, because Jupyter Lab saves automatically, but you can still save anytime if you want to.)
====

With the key parts of this screen explained, go ahead and start *Datamine Notebook* and click the orange Start button! After a bit of waiting, you should see something like below while you are waiting for just a few seconds (sometimes it is fast and you will not even see this!)

image::f25-101-p1-2.png[Launch Jupyter Lab, width=792, height=250, loading=lazy, title="Launch Jupyter Lab"]

and then, when the Jupyter Lab is ready for you to work, you will see this:

image::f25-101-p1-3.png[Jupyter Lab, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Jupyter Lab"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
You likely noticed a short wait before your Jupyter session launched. This happens while Anvil finds and allocates space for you to work. The more students are working on Anvil, the longer this will take, so it is our suggesting to start your projects early during the week to avoid any last-minute hiccups causing a missed deadline.  *Please do not wait until Wednesdays to complete and submit your work!*
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The projects are usually due on *Wednesdays*.  You can see the schedule here:  https://the-examples-book.com/projects/fall2025/10100/projects  *Please do not wait until Wednesday to complete and submit your work!*
====

Download the project template, as described here:  https://the-examples-book.com/projects/templates[https://the-examples-book.com/projects/templates]

When you first open the template, you may get a pop-up asking you to select what kernel you'll be using. Select the `seminar` kernel (not the `seminar-r` kernel). If you do not get this pop-up, you can also select a kernel by clicking on the upper right part of your screen that likely says something similar to `No Kernel`, and then selecting the kernel you want to use.

We give some information about kernels here:  https://the-examples-book.com/projects/kernels

As you continue to get comfortable with Jupyter Lab, you might want to https://the-examples-book.com/tools/anvil/jupyter[read more about Jupyter Lab] (this is optional).

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

For the first question in this project, let's try the first R example from the kernel page:  https://the-examples-book.com/projects/kernels

We will load the airports data set in R, using the `seminar` kernel, and will display the head of the airports data set.  The `head` is the first six lines of the data, and the names of the columns appear above the head.

[source, python]
----
%%R
myDF <- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv")
head(myDF)
----

Just try this R code using the `seminar` kernel (not the `seminar-r` kernel) and make sure that you can see the first six rows of the airports data frame.

.Deliverables
====
- Use R to show the first six rows of the airports data frame.
- Then use R again to show the first twelve rows of the airports data frame, using the `n=12` argument.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 1, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Now do this again, using the `seminar-r` kernel with R, and notice that you do *NOT* need the `%%R` cell magic with the `seminar-r` kernel.  You can do all of this in the same Jupyter Lab notebook, just by changing the kernel.

[source,R]
----
myDF <- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv")
head(myDF)
----

You have now loaded the first six lines of the airports data frame in three ways (once in Question 1, and now a second and a third time in Question 2).

A Jupyter notebook is made up of `cells`, which you can edit and then `run`. There are two types of cells we'll work in for this class:

- Markdown cells. These are where your writing, titles, sections, and paragraphs will go. Double clicking a markdown cell puts it in `edit` mode, and then clicking the play button near the top of the screen runs the cell, which puts it in its formatted form. More on this in a second. For now, just recognize that most markdown looks like regular text with extra characters like `#`, `*`, and `-` to specify bolding, indentation font, size, and more! 
- Code cells. These are where you will write and run all your code! Clicking the play button will run the code in that cell, and the programming language is specified by the language or languages known by the kernel that you chose.

*For each question in The Data Mine*, please always be sure to put some comments after your cells, which describe all of the work that you are doing in the cells, as well as your thinking and insights about the results.

[NOTE]
====
Some common Jupyter notebooks shortcuts:

- Instead of clicking the `play button`, you can press ctrl+enter (or cmd+enter on Mac) to run a cell.
- If you want to run a cell and then move immediately to the next cell, you can use shift+enter. This is oftentimes more useful than ctrl+enter
- If you want to run the current cell and then immediately create a new code cell below it, you can press alt+enter (or option+enter on Mac) to do so.
- When a cell is selected (this means you clicked next to it, and it should show a blue bar to its left to signify this), pressing the `d` key twice will delete that cell.
- When a cell is selected, pressing the `a` key will create a new code cell `a`bove the currently selected cell.
- When a cell is selected, pressing the `b` key will create a new code cell `b`elow the selected cell
====

.Deliverables
====
- Use R to (again) show the output with the first twelve rows of the airports data frame, this time using the `seminar-r` kernel instead of the `seminar` kernel.
- Now use R to show the first ten rows of airports that are located in Indiana.
- How many airports are located in Indiana altogether?  (Use the `dim` function, as shown in the video.)
- Be sure to document your work from Question 2, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

In the year 2007, count the number of flights that originate from each airport.  Which 20 airports are the most popular in this regard, i.e., in terms of having the most flights originating from those airports?

You can load the data for the 2007 flights using:

[source, R]
----
library(data.table)
myDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/2007.csv")
----

and you can be sure to be able to see all of the columns (up to a maximum of 50 columns) using the command:

and then the `value_counts` function gives the number of airports in each state:

[source, R]
----
options(repr.matrix.max.cols=50)
----

Finally, make a table, sort the results, and display the biggest 20 values, as shown in the video.

.Deliverables
====
- Which 20 airports are the most popular in this regard, i.e., in terms of having the most flights originating from those airports?
- Be sure to document your work from Question 3, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Now load the ice cream products data set, stored here:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/products.csv`

Using the `value_counts` function with the `brand` column from the ice cream products data set, how many rows are associated with each `brand`?  In other words, how many times does each `brand` occur in the `brand` column?

Now solve the same question with a different data set.
First load the head of the ice cream reviews data set, and then find how many times each `brand` occurs in the ice cream reviews data set:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv`

How many times does each brand occur in the `reviews.csv` data set?

You work will be similar to the work from Question 3.  Be sure to document each question with comments about your work.

.Deliverables
====
- Use the `value_counts` function to find the number of times that each `brand` occurs in the ice cream products data set.
- Then use the `value_counts` function again, to find the number of times that each `brand` occurs in the ice cream reviews data set.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Now we use `matplotlib` to display the `value_counts` from Question 4.  To accomplish this, we first load `matplotlib` as follows:

[source, python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
----

Then we can save our counts into a variable, which we choose to call `mycounts` like this:

[source, python]
----
mycounts = myDF['brand'].value_counts()
----

and finally we can plot the names of the brands (which are the `index` values in `mycounts`) on the x-axis, and the values on the y-axis, as follows:

[source, python]
----
plt.bar(mycounts.index, mycounts)
----

Give this a try yourself, with BOTH of the data sets from Question 4.

In other words, make one plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream products data set, and then make another plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream reviews data set.

.Deliverables
====
- Make one plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream products data set, and then make another plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream reviews data set.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 5, using some comments and insights about your work.

== Submitting your Work

Please make sure that you added comments for each question, which explain your thinking about your method of solving each question.  Please also make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

Congratulations! Assuming you've completed all the above questions, you've just finished your first project for TDM 10200! If you have any questions or issues regarding this project, please feel free to ask in seminar, over Piazza, or during office hours.

Prior to submitting your work, you need to put your work xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[into the project template], and re-run all of the code in Jupyter Lab and make sure that the results of running that code is visible in your template.  Please check the xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[detailed instructions on how to ensure that your submission is formatted correctly]. To download your completed project, you can right-click on the file in the file explorer and click 'download'.

Once you upload your submission to Gradescope, make sure that everything appears as you would expect to ensure that you don't lose any points. We hope your first project with us went well, and we look forward to continuing to learn with you on future projects!!

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project1.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
It is necessary to document your work, with comments about each solution.  All of your work needs to be your own work, with citations to any source that you used.  Please make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not.

**Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
