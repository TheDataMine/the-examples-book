= TDM 30100: Project 3 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Documentation is one of the most critical parts of a project. https://notion.so[There] https://guides.github.com/features/issues/[are] https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html[so] https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis[many] https://www.gitbook.com/[tools] https://readthedocs.org/[that] https://bit.ai/[are] https://clickhelp.com[specifically] https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html[designed] https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[to] https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html[help] https://pdoc.dev[document] https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor[a] https://swagger.io/[project], and each have their own set of pros and cons. Depending on the scope and scale of the project, different tools will be more or less appropriate. For documenting Python code, however, you can't go wrong with tools like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[Sphinx], or https://pdoc.dev[pdoc].

**Context:** This is the second project in a 2-project series where we explore thoroughly documenting Python code, while solving data-driven problems.

**Scope:** Python, documentation

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use Sphinx to document a set of Python code.
- Use pdoc to document a set of Python code.
- Write and use code that serializes and deserializes data.
- Learn the pros and cons of various serialization formats.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/apple/health/watch_dump.xml`

== Questions

[WARNING]
====
Please use Firefox for this project. We can't guarantee good results if you do not.

Before you begin, open Firefox, and where you would normally put a URL, type the following, followed by enter/return.

```
about:config
```

Search for "network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault", and change the value to `false`, and close the tab.
====

=== Question 1

. Create a new directory in your `$HOME` directory called `project03`: `$HOME/project03`
. Create a new Jupyter notebook in that folder called project03.ipynb, based on the normal project template: `$HOME/project03/project03.ipynb`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The majority of this notebook will just contain a single bash cell with the commands used to re-generate the documentation. This is okay, and by design. The main deliverable for this project will end up being some output from the documentation generator -- this will be explicitly specified as we go along and at the end of the project.
====
. Create a module called `firstname_lastname_project03.py` in your `$HOME/project03` directory, with the following contents.

"""This module is for project 3 for TDM 30100.

**Serialization:** Serialization is the process of taking a set or subset of data and transforming it into a specific file format that is designed for transmission over a network, storage, or some other specific use-case.

**Deserialization:** Deserialization is the opposite process from serialization where the serialized data is reverted back into its original form.

The following are some common serialization formats:

- JSON
- Bincode
- MessagePack
- YAML
- TOML
- Pickle
- BSON
- CBOR
- Parquet
- XML
- Protobuf

**JSON:** One of the more wide-spread serialization formats, JSON has the advantages that it is human readable, and has a excellent set of optimized tools written to serialize and deserialize. In addition, it has first-rate support in browsers. A disadvantage is that it is not a fantastic format storage-wise (it takes up lots of space), and parsing large JSON files can use a lot of memory.

**MessagePack:** MessagePack is a non-human-readable file format (binary) that is extremely fast to serialize and deserialize, and is extremely efficient space-wise. It has excellent tooling in many different languages. It is still not the *most* space efficient, or *fastest* to serialize/deserialize, and remains impossible to work with in its serialized form.

Generally, each format is either *human-readable* or *not*. Human readable formats are able to be read by a human when opened up in a text editor, for example. Non human-readable formats are typically in some binary format and will look like random nonsense when opened in a text editor.

Finally, with the modifications above having been made, run the following command in a `bash` cell in Jupyter notebook to generate your documentation.

[source,bash]
----
cd $HOME/project03/docs
make html

Finally, let's take a look at the results! In the left-hand pane in the Jupyter Lab interface, navigate to `$HOME/project03/docs/build/html/`, and right click on the `index.html` file and choose btn:[Open in New Browser Tab]. You should now be able to see your documentation in a new tab. It should look something like the following.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you are able to generate the documentation before you proceed, otherwise, you will not be able to continue to modify, regenerate, and view your documentation.

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem (in 2 Jupyter `bash` cells).

=== Question 2

One of the most important documents in any package or project is the `README.md` file. This file is so important that version control companies like GitHub and GitLab will automatically display it below the repositories contents. This file contains things like instructions on how to install the packages, usage examples, lists of dependencies, license links, etc. Check out some popular GitHub repositories for projects like `numpy`, `pytorch`, or any other repository you've come across that you believe does a good job explaining the project.

In the `docs/source` folder, create a new file called `README.rst`. Choose 3-5 of the following "types" of reStruturedText from the https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html[this webpage], and create a fake README. The content can be https://www.lipsum.com/[Lorem Ipsum] type of content as long as it demonstrates 3-5 of the types of reStruturedText.

- Inline markup
- Lists and quote-like blocks
- Literal blocks
- Doctest blocks
- Tables
- Hyperlinks
- Sections
- Field lists
- Roles
- Images
- Footnotes
- Citations
- Etc.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to include at least 1 https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#sections[section]. This counts as 1 of your 3-5.
====

Once complete, add a reference to your README to the `index.rst` file. To add a reference to your `README.rst` file, open the `index.rst` file in an editor and add "README" as follows.

.index.rst
[source,rst]
----
.. project3 documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Sep  1 09:38:12 2021.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to project3's documentation!
====================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   README

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure "README" is aligned with ":caption:" -- it should be 3 spaces from the left before the "R" in "README".
====

In a new `bash` cell in your notebook, regenerate your documentation. 

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

cd $HOME/project03/docs
make html
----

Check out the resulting `index.html` page, and click on the links. Pretty great!

[TIP]
====
Things should look similar to the following images.

image::figure35.webp[Sphinx output, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Sphinx output"]

====

=== Question 3

The `pdoc` package was specifically designed to generate documentation for Python modules using the docstrings _in_ the module. As you may have noticed, this is not "native" to Sphinx. 

Sphinx has https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html[extensions]. One such extension is the https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html[autodoc] extension. This extension provides the same sort of functionality that `pdoc` provides natively.

To use this extension, modify the `conf.py` file in the `docs/source` folder. 

[source,python]
----
# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc'
]
----

Next, update your `index.rst` file so autodoc knows which modules to extract data from.

[source,rst]
----
.. project3 documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Sep  1 09:38:12 2021.

====

=== Question 4

Okay, while the documentation looks pretty good, clearly, Sphinx does _not_ recognize Google style docstrings. As you may have guessed, there is an extension for that.

Add the `napoleon` extension to your `conf.py` file.

[source,python]
----
# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon'
]
----

In a new `bash` cell in your notebook, regenerate your documentation. Check out the resulting `index.html` page, and click on the links. Much better!
