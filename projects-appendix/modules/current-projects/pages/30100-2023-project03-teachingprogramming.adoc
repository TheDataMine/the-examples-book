= TDM 30100: Project 3 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Documentation is one of the most critical parts of a project. https://notion.so[There] https://guides.github.com/features/issues/[are] https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html[so] https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis[many] https://www.gitbook.com/[tools] https://readthedocs.org/[that] https://bit.ai/[are] https://clickhelp.com[specifically] https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html[designed] https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[to] https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html[help] https://pdoc.dev[document] https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor[a] https://swagger.io/[project], and each have their own set of pros and cons. Depending on the scope and scale of the project, different tools will be more or less appropriate. For documenting Python code, however, you can't go wrong with tools like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[Sphinx], or https://pdoc.dev[pdoc].

**Context:** This is the second project in a 2-project series where we explore thoroughly documenting Python code, while solving data-driven problems.

**Scope:** Python, documentation

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use Sphinx to document a set of Python code.
- Use pdoc to document a set of Python code.
- Write and use code that serializes and deserializes data.
- Learn the pros and cons of various serialization formats.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/apple/health/watch_dump.xml`

== Questions

[WARNING]
====
Please use Firefox for this project. While other browsers like Chrome and Edge may work, we are providing instructions that are specific to Firefox and you may need to do a bit of research before getting another browser to work.

Before you begin, open Firefox, and where you would normally put a URL, type the following, followed by enter/return.

```
about:config
```

Search for `network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault`, and change the value to `false`, and close the tab. (This was set to `false` in my browser, so don't be concerned if yours isn't `true` by default. Just ensure it is set to `false` before starting the project.)
====

=== Question 1 (1 pt)
[upperalpha]
.. Create a new directory in your `$HOME` directory called `project03`: `$HOME/project03`
.. Create a new copy of the project template in a Jupyter notebook in your project03 folder called project03.ipynb.
.. Create a module called `firstname_lastname_project03.py` in your `$HOME/project03` directory, with the contents of the previous project.
.. Write a module-level docstring for your project03 module.
.. Write a function-level docstring for the `get_records_for_date` function.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You may be concerned that this project will leave your Jupyter notebook looking empty. This is intended, as the majority of the deliverables for this project will be the documentation generated by bash code you will write soon. Additionally, we will explicity specify what the deliverables are step-by-step in each question, so you will know exactly what to submit.
====

First, start by creating your new directory and copying in the template. While the deliverables say this has to have a path of `$HOME/project03`, you can put it anywhere you want, just note that you will have to update your code to reflect the location you choose and your final submission should not contain files unrelated to this specific project.

Next, copy the code you wrote in the previous project into a new python file in your project 3 directory called `firstname_lastname_project03.py`. If you didn't finish the previous project, feel free to copy in the below code to get up-to-date. Then fill in a module-level docstring for the module along with a function-level docstring for the `get_records_for_date` function, both using Google style docstrings.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you change "firstname" and "lastname" to _your_ first and last name.

"""
This module is for project 3 for TDM 30100.

**Serialization:** Serialization is the process of taking a set or subset of data and transforming it into a specific file format that is designed for transmission over a network, storage, or some other specific use-case.

**Deserialization:** Deserialization is the opposite process from serialization where the serialized data is reverted back into its original form.

The following are some common serialization formats:

- JSON
- Bincode
- MessagePack
- YAML
- TOML
- Pickle
- BSON
- CBOR
- Parquet
- XML
- Protobuf

**JSON:** One of the more wide-spread serialization formats, JSON has the advantages that it is human readable, and has a excellent set of optimized tools written to serialize and deserialize. In addition, it has first-rate support in browsers. A disadvantage is that it is not a fantastic format storage-wise (it takes up lots of space), and parsing large JSON files can use a lot of memory.

**MessagePack:** MessagePack is a non-human-readable file format (binary) that is extremely fast to serialize and deserialize, and is extremely efficient space-wise. It has excellent tooling in many different languages. It is still not the *most* space efficient, or *fastest* to serialize/deserialize, and remains impossible to work with in its serialized form.

Generally, each format is either *human-readable* or *not*. Human readable formats are able to be read by a human when opened up in a text editor, for example. Non human-readable formats are typically in some binary format and will look like random nonsense when opened in a text editor.

Next, in a `bash` cell in your `project03.ipynb` notebook, run the following, replacing "Firstname Lastname" with your name.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

cd $HOME/project03
python3 -m sphinx.cmd.quickstart ./docs -q -p project03 -a "Firstname Lastname" -v 1.0.0 --sep

[NOTE]
====
What do all of these arguments do? Check out https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-quickstart.html[this page of the official documentation].
====

You should be left with a newly created `docs` directory within your `project03` directory: `$HOME/project03/docs`. The directory structure should look similar to the following.

Finally, let's take a look at the results! In the left-hand pane in the Jupyter Lab interface, navigate to `$HOME/project03/docs/build/html/`, and right click on the `index.html` file and choose btn:[Open in New Browser Tab]. You should now be able to see your documentation in a new tab. It should look something like the following.

image::figure34.webp[Resulting Sphinx output, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Resulting Sphinx output"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you are able to generate the documentation before you proceed, otherwise, you will not be able to continue to modify, regenerate, and view your documentation.
====

.Items to submit
====
- Directory for project 3, containing an ipynb file and a python file as described above.
- Module and function level docstrings where appropriate in the python file.
- Documentation generated by Sphinx, as instructed above.
====


=== Question 2 (2 pts)
[upperalpha]
.. Write a function called `get_avg_heart_rate` to get the average heart rate for a given date from our watch data.
.. Write a function called `get_median_heart_rate` to find median heart rate for a given date from our watch data.
.. Write a function called `graph_heart_rate` to create a box-and-whisker plot of heart rate for a given date from our watch data.
.. Give each function an appropriate docstring.
.. Run each function for April 4th, 2019 in your Jupyter notebook to prove they work. Ensure you add them to project03-key.py.
.. Regenerate your documentation, and view the results in a new tab.

[NOTE]
====
While you could redefine all of your logic to get data for a given date, it would be much easier to simply reuse the function you wrote in the previous project within your new functions.
====

[TIP]
====
Feel free to use library functions for the above functions (i.e. statistics for mean and median and matplotlib for plotting)
====

You can test your code using the following code in your Jupyter notebook:

[source,python]
----
date_records = get_records_for_date(tree, for_date)
print(f"Average: {format(get_avg_heart_rate(date_records),'.2f')}")
print(f"Median : {format(get_median_heart_rate(date_records),'.2f')}")
graph_heart_rate(date_records)

# This should output values in a format similar to the following:
# Average: 86.25
# Median : 83.00
# The box and whisker plot should reflect what you see in the average/median measures. Feel free to write an extra function to get standard deviations or quartiles for a more accurate way to check your work is correct.
----

.Items to submit
====
- 3 functions, named and as described above, including function-level docstrings.
- Outputs of running the functions on April 4th, 2019.
- Documentation generated by Sphinx, as instructed above.
====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)
[upperalpha]
.. Create your own README.rst file in the `docs/source` folder.
.. regenerate your documentation, and take a picture of the resulting webpage.

One of the most important documents in any package or project is the `README` file. This file is so important that version control companies like GitHub and GitLab will automatically display it below the repositories contents. This file contains things like instructions on how to install the packages, usage examples, lists of dependencies, license links, etc. Check out some popular GitHub repositories for projects like `numpy`, `pytorch`, or any other repository you've come across that you believe does a good job explaining the project.

In the `docs/source` folder, create a new file called `README.rst`. Choose 5 of the following "types" of reStructuredText from the https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html[this webpage], and create a fake README. The content can be https://www.lipsum.com/[Lorem Ipsum] type of content as long as it demonstrates 5 of the types of reStructuredText.

- Inline markup
- Lists and quote-like blocks
- Literal blocks
- Doctest blocks
- Tables
- Hyperlinks
- Sections
- Field lists
- Roles
- Images
- Footnotes
- Citations
- Etc.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to include at least 1 https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#sections[section]. This counts as 1 of your 5 types of reStructuredText.
====

Once complete, add a reference to your README to the `index.rst` file. To add a reference to your `README.rst` file, open the `index.rst` file in an editor and add "README" as follows.

.index.rst

.. project3 documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Sep  1 09:38:12 2021.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to project3's documentation!

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure "README" is aligned with ":caption:" -- it should be 3 spaces from the left before the "R" in "README".
====

In a new `bash` cell in your notebook, regenerate your documentation. 

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

cd $HOME/project03/docs
make html
----

Check out the resulting `index.html` page, and click on the links. Pretty great!

[TIP]

====

=== Question 4 (1 pt)
.. Add autodoc configuration to your `conf.py` file, regenerate your documentation, and take a picture of the resulting webpage.

The `pdoc` package was specifically designed to generate documentation for Python modules using the docstrings _in_ the module. As you may have noticed, this is not "native" to Sphinx. 

Sphinx has https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html[extensions]. One such extension is the https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html[autodoc] extension. This extension provides the same sort of functionality that `pdoc` provides natively.

To use this extension, modify the `conf.py` file in the `docs/source` folder. 

[source,python]
----
# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc'
]
----

Next, update your `index.rst` file so autodoc knows which modules to extract data from.

[source,rst]
----
.. project3 documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Sep  1 09:38:12 2021.

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
----

In a new `bash` cell in your notebook, regenerate your documentation. Check out the resulting `index.html` page, and click on the links. Not too bad!

.Items to submit
====
- Screenshot labeled "question03_results". Make sure you https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/templates#including-an-image-in-your-notebook[include your screenshot correctly].
- OR a PDF created by exporting the webpage.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)
.. Import the appropriate extensions so that Sphinx recognizes Google_style docstrings.
.. Create a new function, `graph_avg_heart_rate`, that graphs the average heart rate for all dates in our watch data.
.. Regenerate your documentation, and take a picture of the resulting webpage.

Okay, while the documentation looks pretty good, clearly, Sphinx does _not_ recognize Google style docstrings. As you may have guessed, there is an extension for that.

Add the `napoleon` extension to your `conf.py` file.

[source,python]
----
# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon'
]
----

Next, we would like you to write a new function called `graph_average_heart_rate` that graphs the average heart rate for all dates in our watch data. The type of graph your function generates is up to you, but it should be a meaningful and well-labeled graphic that demonstrates something about the data (i.e. shape, outliers, etc.). Make sure to include a Google style docstring for your function.

[TIP]
====
When writing more complicated functions, think about the steps they need to do. For example, our function needs to do the following:

for each date in our data: +
- get the records for that date +
- get the average heart rate for that date +
- add the average heart rate to a list of averages +

Then, finally, graph the list of averages.

I think simply by looking at this pseudocode in combination with the functions you wrote for previous questions, you should be able to get a good idea of how to structure and write this function.
====

In a new `bash` cell in your notebook, regenerate your documentation. Check out the resulting `index.html` page, and click on the links. Much better! Take a final screenshot of your `index.html` page, and include it in this question's submission section

.Items to submit
====
- function `graph_avg_heart_rate` with a Google style docstring.
- Regenerated final documentation to recognize Google style docstrings.
- Screenshot labeled "question05_results". Make sure you https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/templates#including-an-image-in-your-notebook[include your screenshot correctly].
