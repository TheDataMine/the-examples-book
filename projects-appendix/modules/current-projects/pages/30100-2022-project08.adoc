= TDM 30100: Project 8 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Python is an incredible language that enables users to write code quickly and efficiently. When using Python to write code, you are _typically_ making a tradeoff between developer speed (the time it takes to write a functioning program) and program speed (how fast your code runs). Python code does _not_ have the advantage of easily being compiled to machine code and shared. In Python, you need to learn how to use virtual environments, and it is good to have an understanding of how to build and push a package to pypi.

**Context:** This is the first in a series of 3 projects that focuses on setting up and using virtual environments, and creating a package. This is not intended to teach you everything, but rather, give you some exposure to the topics.

**Scope:** Python, virtual environments, pypi

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain what a virtual environment is and why it is important.
- Create, update, and use a virtual environment to run somebody else's Python code.
- Create a Python package and publish it on pypi.

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

== Questions

=== Question 1

This project will be focused on creating, updating, and understanding Python virtual environments. Since this is The Data Mine, we will pepper in some small data-related tasks, like writing functions to operate on data, but the focus is on virtual environments.

Let's get started.

Use https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#how-can-you-work-with-a-python-virtual-environment[this article] as your reference. First thing is first. We have a Jupyter notebook that we tend to work in, running our `bash` code in `bash` cells. This is very different than your typical environment. For this reason, let's start by popping open a terminal, and working in the terminal.

You can open a terminal in JupyterLab by clicking on the blue "+" button in the upper left-hand corner of the Jupyter interface. Scroll down to the last row and click on the button that says "Terminal".

Start by taking a look at which `python3` you are running. Run the following in the terminal.

[source,bash]
----
which python3
----

Take a look at the available packages as follows.

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip list
----

This doesn't look right, it doesn't look like our f2022-s2023 environment, does it? It doesn't even have `pandas` installed. This is because we don't have JupyterLab configured to have our f2022-s2023 version of Python pre-loaded in a fresh terminal session. In fact, with this project, we aren't going to use that environment! 

[NOTE]
====
The `f2022-s2023` environment runs inside a container. You will learn more about this later on, but suffice it to say it makes it much more difficult to do what we want to do for this project. 
====

Instead, we are going to use the non-containerized version of Python that is running the JupyterLab instance itself! To load up this environment, run the following.

[source,bash]
----
module load python/jupyterlab
----

Then, check out how things have changed.

[source,bash]
----
which python3
----

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip list
----

Looks like we are getting there! Let's back up a bit and explain some things. 

What does `which python3` do? `which` will print out the absolute path to the command which would be executed. In this case, running `python3` would be the same as executing `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/bin/python3`.

What does the `python3 -m pip` mean? The `-m` stands for https://docs.python.org/3.8/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m[module-name]. In a nutshell, this ensures that the correct `pip` -- the `pip` associated with the current `python3` is used! This is important, because, if you have many versions of Python installed on your system, if environment variables aren't correctly set, it could be possible to use a completely different `pip` associated with a completely different version of Python, which could cause all sorts of errors! To prevent this, it is safer to do `python3 -m pip` instead of just `pip`.

What does `python3 -m pip list` do? The `python3 -m pip` is the same as before. The `list` command is an argument you can pass to `pip` that lists the packages installed in the current environment.

Perform the following operations.

. Use `venv` to create a new virtual environment called `question01`.
. Confirm that the virtual environment has been created by running the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
source question01/bin/activate
----
+
. This should _activate_ your virtual environment. You will notice that `python3` now points to an interpreter in your virtual environment directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
which python3
----
+
.output
----
/path/to/question01/bin/python3
----
+
. In addition, you can see the blank slate when it comes to installed Python packages.
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip list
----
+
.output
----
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        22.0.4
setuptools 58.1.0
WARNING: You are using pip version 22.0.4; however, version 22.2.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the '/home/x-kamstut/question01/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

.Items to submit
====
See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/templates#including-an-image-in-your-notebook[here] on how to properly include a screenshot in your Jupyter notebook. If you do _not_ properly submit the screenshot, you will likely lose points, so _please_ take a minute to read it.

- Screenshot showing `source question01/bin/activate` output.
- Screenshot showing `which python3` output _after_ activating the virtual environment.
- Screenshow showing `python3 -m pip list` output _after_ activating the virtual environment.
====

=== Question 2

Okay, in question (1) you ran some commands and supposedly created your own virtual environment. You are possibly still confused on what you did or why -- that is okay! Things will _hopefully_ become more clear as you progress.

Read https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#why-do-you-need-virtual-environments[this] section of the article provided in question (1). In your own words, explain 2 good reasons why virtual environments are important when using Python. Place these explanations in a markdown cell in your notebook.

[NOTE]
====
We are going to create and modify and destroy environments quite a bit! Don't be intimidated by messing around with your environment.
====

Okay, now that you've grokked why virtual environments are important, let's try to see a virtual environment in action.

Activate your empty virtual environment from question (1) (if it is not already active). If you were to try and import the `requests` package, what do you expect would happen? If you were to deactivate your virtual environment and then try and import the `requests` package, what would you expect would happen?

Test out both! First activate your virtual environment from question (1), and then run `python3` and try to `import requests`. Next, run `deactivate` to deactivate your virtual environment. Run `python3` and try to `import requests`. Were the results what you expected? Please include 2 screenshots -- 1 for each attempt at importing `requests`.

[NOTE]
====
As you should _hopefully_ see -- the virtual environments _do_ work! When a certain environment is active, only a certain set of packages is made available! Pretty cool!
====

.Items to submit
====
- 1-2 sentences, _per reason_, on why virtual environments are important when using Python.
- 1 screenshot showing the attempt to import the `requests` library from within your question01 virtual environment.
- 1 screenshot showing the attempt to import the `requests` library from outside the question01 virtual environment.
====

=== Question 3

Create a Python script called `imdb.py` that accepts a single argument, `id`, and prints out the following.

[source,bash]
----
python3 imdb.py imdb tt4236770
----

.output
----
Title: Yellowstone
Rating: 8.6
----

You can use the following as your skeleton.

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sqlite3
import sys
from rich import print

def get_info(iid: str) -> None:
    """
    Given an imdb id, print out some basic info about the title.
    """
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db")
    cur = conn.cursor()

    # make a query (fill in code here)

    # print results
    print(f"Title: [bold blue]{title}[/bold blue]\nRating: [bold green]{rating}[/bold green]")

    
def main():
	parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
	subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(help="possible commands", dest="command")
	some_parser = subparsers.add_parser("imdb", help="")
	some_parser.add_argument("id", help="id to get info about")

	if len(sys.argv) == 1:
		parser.print_help()
		sys.exit(1)

	args = parser.parse_args()

	if args.command == "imdb":
		get_info(args.id)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
----

Deactivate any environment you may have active.

[source,bash]
----
deactivate
----

Confirm that the proper `python3` is active.

[source,bash]
----
which python3
----

.output
----
/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/bin/python3
----

Now test out your script by running the following.

[source,bash]
----
python3 imdb.py imdb tt4236770
----

What happens? Well, the package `rich` should not be installed to our current environment. Easy enough to fix, right? After all, we know how to make our own virtual environments now!

Create a virtual environment called `question03`. This time, when creating your virtual environment, add an additional flag `--copies` to the very end of the command. Activate your virtual environment and confirm that we are using the correct environment.

[source,bash]
----
source question03/bin/activate
which python3
----

Immediately trying the script again should fail, since we _still_ don't have the `rich` package installed.

[source,bash]
----
python3 imdb.py imdb tt4236770
----

.output
----
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rich'
----

Okay! Use `pip` (using our `python3 -m pip` trick) to install `rich` and try to run the script again!

Not only should the script now work, but, if you take a look at the packages installed in your environment, there should be some new additions.

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip list
----

.output
----
Package    Version
---------- -------
commonmark 0.9.1
pip        22.0.4
Pygments   2.13.0
rich       12.6.0
setuptools 58.1.0
----

That is awesome! You just solved the issue of not being able to run some Python code because a package was not installed for you. You did this by first creating your own custom Python virtual environment, installing the required package to your virtual environment, and then executing the code that wasn't previously working!

.Items to submit
====
- Screenshot showing the activation of the `question03` virtual environment, the `pip` install, and successful output of the script.
- Screenshot showing the resulting set of packages, `python3 -m pip list`, for the `question03` virtual environment.
====

=== Question 4

Okay, let's take a tiny step back to peek at a few underlying details of our `question01` and `question03` virtual environments.

Specifically, start with the `question01` environment. The entire environment lives within that `question01` directory doesn't it? Or _does it!?

[source,bash]
----
ls -la question01/bin
----

Notice anything about the contents of the `question01` bin directory? They are symbolic links! `python3` actually points to the same interpreter that was active when we created the virtual environment, the `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/bin/python3` interpreter! But wait, how do we have a different set of packages then, if we are using the same Python interpreter? The answer is, your Python interpreter will look in a variety of locations for your packages. By activating your virtual environment, we've altered our `PYTHONPATH`. 

If you run the following, you will see the list of directories that Python searches for packages, when importing.

[source,python]
----
import sys

sys.path
----

.example output
----
['', '/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python3.10/site-packages', '/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python3.10', '/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python310.zip', '/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python3.10', '/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload', '/home/x-kamstut/question01/lib/python3.10/site-packages']
----

`sys.path` is initialized from the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, plus some additional installation-dependent defaults. If you take a peek in `question01/lib/python3.10/site-packages`, you will see where `rich` is located. So, even if you look `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python3.10/site-packages`, and see that `rich` is _not_ installed in that location, because Python searches _all_ of those locations for `rich` and `rich` _is_ installed in `question01/lib/python3.10/site-packages`, it will be successfully imported!

This begs the question, what if `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/python/3.10.5/lib/python3.10/site-packages` has an _older_ version of `rich` installed -- which version will be imported? Well, let's test this out!

If you look at `plotly` in the jupyterlab environment, you will see it is version 5.8.2.

[source,python]
----
import plotly
plotly.__version__
----

.output
----
5.8.2
----

Activate your `question03` environment and install `plotly==5.10.0`. Re-run the following code.

[source,python]
----
import plotly
plotly.__version__
----

What is your output? Is that expected? 

[WARNING]
====
We modified this question Thursday, October 27 due to a mistake by your instructor (Kevin). If you previously did this problem, no worries, you will get credit either way.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you take a look at `question03/bin/python` you will notice that they are _not_ symbolic links, but actual copies of the original interpreter! This is what the `--copies` argument did earlier on! In general, you'll likely be fine using `venv` without the `--copies` flag.

=== Question 5

Last, but certainly not least, is the important topic of _pinning_ dependencies. This practice will allow someone else to replicate the exact set of packages needed to run your Python application. 

By default, `python3 -m pip install numpy` will install the newest compatible version of numpy to your current environment. Sometimes, that version could be too new and create issues with old code. This is why pinning is important. 

You can choose to install an exact version of a package by specifying the version. For example, you could install `numpy` version 1.16, even though the newest version is (as of writing) 1.23. Just run `python3 -m pip install numpy==1.16`.

This is great, but is there an easy way to pass an entire list of all of the packages in your current virtual environment? Yes! Yes there is! Try it out.

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
cat requirements.txt
----

That's pretty cool! That is a specially formatted list containing a pinned set of packages. You could do the reverse as well. Create a new file called `requirements.txt` with the following contents copied and pasted.

.requirements.txt contents
----
commonmark==0.9.1
plotly==5.10.0
Pygments==2.13.0
requests==2.2.1
rich==12.6.0
tenacity==8.1.0
thedatamine==0.1.3
----

You can use the `-r` option of `pip` to install all of those pinned packages to an environment. Test it out! Create another new virtual environment called `question05`, activate the environment, and use the `-r` option and the `requirements.txt` file to install all of the packages, with the exact same versions. Double check that the results are the same, and that the installed packages are identical to the `requirements.txt` file. 

Great job! Now, with some Python code, and a `requirements.txt` file, you should be able to setup a virtual environment and run your friend or co-workers code! Very cool!

Unfortunately, there is more to this mess than meets the eye, and a _lot_ more that can go wrong. But these basics will serve you well and help you solve lots and lots of problems!
