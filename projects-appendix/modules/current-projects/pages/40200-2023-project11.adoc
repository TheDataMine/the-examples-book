= TDM 40200: Project 11 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Containers are everywhere and a very popular method of packaging an application with all of the requisite dependencies. In the previous series of projects you've built a web application. While right now it may be easy to share and run your application with another individual, as time goes on and packages are updated, this is less and less likely to be the case. Containerizing your application ensures that the application will have the proper versions of the proper packages available in the proper location to run.

**Context:** This is a first of a series of projects focused on containers. The end goal of this series is to solidify the concept of a container, and enable you to "containerize" the application you've spent the semester building. You will even get the opportunity to deploy your containerized application!

**Scope:** Python, containers, UNIX

.Learning Objectives
****
- Improve your mental model of what a container is and why it is useful.
- Use UNIX tools to effectively create a container.

== Questions

=== Question 1

The most popular containerization tool at the time of writing is likely Docker. Unfortunately, Docker is not available on Anvil, as it currently does not enable _rootless_ container creation. In addition, for this first project, we want to mess around with some UNIX tools to _essentially_ create a container -- these tools _also_ require superuser permissions. Therefore, this project will be completed completely from within a shell, using shell tools, on a virtual machine which you will launch. 

We will essentially be running a container on a virtual machine from within a SLURM job on Anvil. Sounds a bit crazy, and it is, but it will provide you with the ability to work fearlessly and break things. Of course, if you _do_ break things, you can _easily_ reset!

First thing is first. Open up a terminal on Anvil. This could be from within Jupyter Lab, or via VS Code, or just from an `ssh` session from within your own terminal. 

Next, to ensure that SLURM environment variables don't alter or effect our SLURM job, run the following.

[source,bash]
----
for i in $(env | awk -F= '/SLURM/ {print $1}'); do unset $i; done;
----

Next, let's make a copy of a pre-made operating system image. This image has Alpine Linux and a few basic tools installed, including: nano, vim, emacs, and Docker. 

[source,bash]
----
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/apps/qemu/images/builder.qcow2 $SCRATCH
----

Next, we want to acquire enough resources (CPU and memory) to not have to worry about something not working. To do this we will use SLURM to launch a job with 4 cores and about 8GB of memory.

[source,bash]
----
salloc -A cis220051 -p shared -n 4 -c 1 -t 04:00:00
----

Next, we need to make `qemu` available to our shell.

[source,bash]
----
module load qemu
----

Next, let's launch our virtual machine with about 8GB of memory and 4 cores.

[source,bash]
----
qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc none,ipv4 -hda $SCRATCH/builder.qcow2 -m 8G -smp 4 -enable-kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2200-:22 &
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If for some reason you get an error or message saying that port 2200 is being used, no problem! Just change the number in the previous command from 2200 to the output of the following command.

[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
find_port # this will print a port number
----

Then, when you run the `ssh` command below, use the port number that was printed by `find_port`, instead of 2200.
====

Next, its time to connect to our virtual machine. We will use `ssh` to do this.

[source,bash]
----
ssh -p 2200 tdm@localhost -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
----

If the command fails, try waiting a minute and rerunning the command -- it may take a minute for the virtual machine to boot up.

When prompted for a password, enter `purdue`. Your username is `tdm` and password is `purdue`.

Finally, now that you have a shell in your virtual machine, you can do anything you want! You have superuser permissions within your virtual machine! To run a command as the super user prepend `doas` to the command. For example, to list the files in the `/root` directory, you would run: `doas ls /root` -- it may prompt you for a password, which is `purdue`. 

If at any time you break something and don't know how to fix it, you can "reset" everything by simply killing the virtual machine, removing `$SCRATCH/builder.qcow2`, and rerunning the commands above.

To kill the virtual machine.

[source,bash]
----
# exit the virtual machine by typing "exit" then, on Anvil, run:
fg %1 # or fg 1 -- this will bring the process to the foreground
# finally, press CTRL+C to kill the process
----

For this question, submit a screenshot showing the output of `hostname` from within your virtual machine!

=== Question 2

[TIP]
====
I would highly recommend watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc. It is an excellent 40 minute video where the author essentially creates a container using golang. While you may not understand golang, she does a great job of explaining, and it will give you a good idea of what is going on.
====

[TIP]
====
This link: https://ericchiang.github.io/post/containers-from-scratch/

Is the inspiration for this project. We are just translating it over using our own tools and resources.
====

First thing is first. Let's get a root filesystem that will be the "base" of our container. Since our virtual machine is running Alpine Linux, it could be cool to have our container be based on a different operating system -- let's use Ubuntu.

From within your virtual machine, run the following.

[NOTE]
====
From this point forward, when we ask you to run any command, please assume we mean from inside your virtual machine unless otherwise specified.
====

[source,bash]
----
wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.6/ubuntu-20.04.6-live-server-amd64.iso
----

This will download the `.iso` file from Ubuntu. Next, we need to mount the `.iso` file so that we can access the files within it.

[source,bash]
----
# create a directory to mount the iso file on
mkdir /home/tdm/ubuntu_mounted

# mount the iso file
doas modprobe loop
doas mount ubuntu-20.04.6-live-server-amd64.iso ubuntu_mounted
----

Now, if you run `ls -la /home/tdm/ubuntu_mounted`, you should see a bunch of files and directories.

.ls -la /home/tdm/ubuntu_mounted
----

lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root             1 Mar 14 18:01 ubuntu -> .
----

We want the _filesystem_ from this iso. The filesystem is inside the following file: `/home/tdm/ubuntu_mounted/casper/filesystem.squashfs`. We have to unarchive that file, but before we can do that we need to install a package.

[source,bash]
----
doas apk add squashfs-tools
----

Now, we can unarchive the file.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs
cp /home/tdm/ubuntu_mounted/casper/filesystem.squashfs /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs
cd /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs
unsquashfs filesystem.squashfs
cd
mv /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs/squashfs-root /home/tdm/
rm -rf /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs/*
cp -r /home/tdm/squashfs-root/* /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs/

# cleanup
doas umount ubuntu_mounted
rmdir /home/tdm/ubuntu_mounted
doas rm ubuntu-20.04.6-live-server-amd64.iso
doas rm -rf /home/tdm/squashfs-root
----

Finally, inside `/home/tdm/ubuntu_fs`, you should see the root filesystem for Ubuntu.

.ls -la /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs

=== Question 3

As mentioned before, we are going to follow very closely to https://ericchiang.github.io/post/containers-from-scratch/[this excellent post]. Therefore, the first tool we will be using is `chroot` (think "change root"). `chroot` is a command that allows you to change the root directory of the current process and its children. 

Currently, our root filesystem (in Alpine Linux _of_ Alpine Linux) is the following:

.ls -la /

We want to make it so that our root filesystem is the contents of our `ubuntu_fs` directory. To do this, we will use the `chroot` command.

[source,bash]
----
doas chroot /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs /bin/bash
----

This will result in running the `/bin/bash` shell where the root filesystem is the contents of the `/home/tdm/ubuntu_fs` directory. You'll have a `bash` shell _inside_ this directory. As a result, for example, you could run commands only available in Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
lsb_release -a
----

As you will be able to see, in _this_ shell, the root filesystem is the contents of the `/home/tdm/ubuntu_fs` directory:

So, when in this shell, running `ls -la` is actually running `/home/tdm/ubuntu_fs/usr/bin/ls -la`. Very cool! This is pretty powerful already and may even _feel_ kind of like a container! Let's test out how isolated we are. Open _another_ terminal and connect to your virtual machine from that terminal as well. This will involve first using `ssh` to connect to the backend where your SLURM job is running, and then using `ssh` to connect to your virtual machine from there. 

[source,bash]
----
ssh a240.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu # connect to the given backend -- in my case, it was a240 -- yours may be different! 
ssh -p 2200 tdm@localhost -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no # connect to the virtual machine
----

Once you are connected to your virtual machine, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
top
----

Now, in your `chroot` "jail", run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mount -t proc proc /proc
ps aux | grep -i top
----

If done correctly, you likely saw output similar to the following.

----
1001      2617  0.0  0.0   1624   960 ?        S+   16:49   0:00 top
root      2622  0.0  0.0   3312   720 ?        S+   16:50   0:00 grep --color=auto -i top
----

We are _inside_ our container, yet we can see the `top` command running on our VM. We are clearly _not_ isolated enough! In fact, from within our "container" we could probably even kill the `top` process that is outside of our "container":

[source,bash]
----
pkill top

# after running this from inside our "container" switch tabs and you'll find that the top process stopped running!
----

To fix this, we need to create a _namespace_. 

[quote, Eric Chiang, https://ericchiang.github.io/post/containers-from-scratch/]
____
Namespaces allow us to create restricted views of systems like the process tree, network interfaces, and mounts.

Creating namespace is super easy, just a single syscall with one argument, unshare. The unshare command line tool gives us a nice wrapper around this syscall and lets us setup namespaces manually. In this case, we will create a PID namespace for the shell, then execute the chroot like the last example.
____

Let's test this out. First, exit our "container" by running `exit`. If you properly exited, the following command will no longer work.

[source,bash]
----
lsb_release -a
----

Now, let's use `unshare` to create a new _process_ or _PID_ namespace.

[source,bash]
----
doas unshare -p -f --mount-proc=/home/tdm/ubuntu_fs/proc chroot /home/tdm/ubuntu_fs /bin/bash
----

Upon success, you will now find that our shell `/bin/bash` seems to think it is process 1!

[source,bash]
----
ps aux
----

.output
----

We are one step closer! For this question, include a series of screenshots showing your terminal input and output.

=== Question 4

Finally, another key component of a container is limiting resources. Eric mentions that it doesn't make a lot of sense to have isolated processes if they can still eat up all of the system CPU and memory and potentially even cause other processes from the host system to crash. This is where `cgroups` (control groups) come in. 

Using `cgroups` we can limit the resources a process can use. For example, we could limit the CPUs or the memory of a process. That is exactly what we will do! Let's start by restricting the cores our container can use. 

On the virtual machine, outside of the container, run the following.

[source,bash]
----
doas su # become the superuser/root

mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/tdm # create a directory for our cpuset cgroup

ps aux # search for the PID of /bin/bash with unshare, mine was 2627
echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/tdm/cpuset.mems
echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/tdm/cpuset.cpus
echo 2627 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/tdm/tasks

# this limits the task with PID 2627 to only use CPU 0

mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/tdm # create a directory for our memory cgroup

# in addition, lets disable swap
echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/tdm/memory.swappiness

# lets also limit the memory to 100 MB
echo 100000000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/tdm/memory.limit_in_bytes

echo 2627 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/tdm/tasks
----

Let's test out the memory cgroup by creating the following `hungry.py` Python script and running it from within our container.

.hungry.py
[source,python]
----
x = bytearray(1024*1024*50)
print("Used 50")
y = bytearray(1024*1024*50)
print("Used 100")
z = bytearray(1024*1024*50)
print("Used 150")
----

Now, running `python3 hungry.py` from within our container should yield:

.output
----
Used 50
Killed

Very cool! Now the process was killed because it exceeded the memory limit we set! Hopefully this project demonstrated that containers are easier than they may seem! Of course, these examples are not complete, and containers and various utilities provided by a tool like Docker are both more feature-rich and sound, however, we hope that this demystified things a little bit. 

[NOTE]
====
There will still be a variety of things that aren't functioning the same way a true container would. For example, running `hostname newhost` in the container would also change the hostname of the VM. You could fix this by adding `--uts` to your `unshare` command. Again, this is just to show you that containers are really just a filesystem + some system calls to isolate the process.
