= TDM 40200: Project 6 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Dashboards are everywhere -- many of our corporate partners' projects are to build dashboards (or dashboard variants)! Dashboards are used to interactively visualize some set of data. Dashboards can be used to display, add, remove, filter, or complete some customized operation to data. Ultimately, a dashboard is really a website focused on displaying data. Dashboards are so popular, there are entire frameworks designed around making them with less effort, faster. Two of the more popular examples of such frameworks are https://shiny.rstudio.com/[`shiny`] (in R) and https://dash.plotly.com/introduction[`dash`] (in Python). While these tools are incredibly useful, it can be very beneficial to take a step back and build a dashboard (or website) from scratch (we are going to utilize many powerfuly packages and tools that make this far from "scratch", but it will still be more from scratch than those dashboard frameworks).

**Context:** This is the fifth in a series of projects focused around slowly building a dashboard. Students will have the opportunity to: create a backend (API) using `fastapi`, connect the backend to a database using `aiosql`, use the `jinja2` templating engine to create a frontend, use `htmx` to add "reactivity" to the frontend, create and use forms to insert data into the database, containerize the application so it can be deployed anywhere, and deploy the application to a cloud provider. Each week the project will build on the previous week, however, each week will be self-contained. This means that you can complete the project in any order, and if you miss a week, you can still complete the following project using the provided starting point.

**Scope:** Python, dashboards

.Learning Objectives
****
- Continue to develop skills and techniques using `fastapi` to build a backend.
- Learn how to use `pydantic` for data validation and type hints.
- Learn how `fastapi` and `pydantic` work together to create endpoints that validate data and return typed responses.
- Create a directory structure to assemble a `fastapi` backend.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

====

=== Question 1

Create a directory in your `$SCRATCH` directory called `imdb`. This will be the "monorepo" that holds your source code for your dashboard -- the frontend, the backend, and any other assets we may end up with. Create all the empty files and folders so your directory structure looks like the following.

.project directory structure
----
imdb
├── backend
│   ├── api
│   │   ├── api.py
│   │   ├── database.py
│   │   ├── imdb.db
│   │   ├── pydantic_models.py
│   │   └── queries.sql
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   ├── README.md
│   └── templates
├── frontend
└── README.md

4 directories, 8 files
----

Once complete, demonstrate you've created everything properly by running the following in Jupyter Notebook cell.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

tree $SCRATCH/imdb
----

=== Question 2

Okay! You are all set now. You have a sane project structure, and you (hopefully) learned all you needed to perform this next task. 

First, we will go ahead and give you the contents of `database.py`.

[source,python]
----
import os
import aiosql
import sqlite3
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path

load_dotenv()

database_path = Path(__file__).parents[0] / "imdb.db"
queries = aiosql.from_path(Path(__file__).parents[0] / "queries.sql", "sqlite3")
----

That way, from another Python module, you can import and use `database_path` and `queries` to interact with the database.

[source,python]
----
from .database import database_path, queries
----

Implement you backend and create the following endpoints in your `api.py` file:

. `GET /titles/{title_id}` -- returns the title information as a `Title` object for the `Title` with the given `title_id`.
. `GET /cast/{title_id}` -- returns the cast information as a `Cast` object for the `Title` with the given `title_id`.
. `GET /people/{person_id}` -- returns the person information as a `Person` object for the `Person` with the given `person_id`.

Fill in the `pydantic_models.py` file with the following models: `Title`, `Cast`, `CastMember`, `Work`, and `Person`.

Fill in `queries.sql` with your `aiosql` queries. While there are multiple ways to do this, I used the following 4 queries: `get_title`, `get_cast`, `get_person`, and `get_work`. The former 2 accept a `title_id` as a parameter, and the latter 2 accept a `person_id` as a parameter.

The following are screenshots from calling the following endpoints. 

image::figure46.webp[Call to /titles/tt2194499, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Call to /titles/tt2194499"]

image::figure47.webp[Call to /cast/tt2194499, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Call to /cast/tt2194499"]

image::figure48.webp[Call to /people/nm1046097, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Call to /people/nm1046097"]

Please replicate each of these screenshots with your _own_ screenshot for the following **different** endpoints.

- `GET /titles/tt1754656`
- `GET /cast/tt1754656`
- `GET /people/nm0748620`

[TIP]
====
Don't forget you can run the following to load up our environment.

[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
module load python/f2022-s2023
----

In addition, you can run the following to find an unused port.

[source,bash]
----
find_port # for example, 7777
----

Then, to run your backend from your `$SCRATCH/imdb` directory, you can run the following.

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m uvicorn backend.api.api:app --reload --port 7777
----
====

[TIP]
====
You can _nest_ `pydantic` models. For example, in my `Person` model, I have a `list[Work]` field. This is a list of `Work` objects.
====

.Items to submit
====
- The entire directory, with all files and folders in the `imdb` directory.
- A jupyter notebook containing the screenshots demonstrating the working endpoints.
====

[WARNING]
====
_Please_ make sure to double check that your submission is complete, and contains all of your code and output before submitting. If you are on a spotty internet connection, it is recommended to download your submission after submitting it to make sure what you _think_ you submitted, was what you _actually_ submitted.

In addition, please review our xref:projects:current-projects:submissions.adoc[submission guidelines] before submitting your project.
