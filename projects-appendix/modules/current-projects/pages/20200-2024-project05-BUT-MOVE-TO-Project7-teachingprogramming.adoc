= TDM 20200: Project 5 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Dash is a web application framework. It can create web based visualization, provide a simple way to create interactive user interfaces. Dash uses Plotly for its plotting capabilities. It can build interactive dashboards for data visualization. 

**Context:** Create good visualizations about housing data using "plotly", "Dash"

**Scope:** Python, visualizations, plotly, Dash, DashBoards, Visual Studio Code

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a development environment to building a dashboard on Anvil 
- Develop skills and techniques to create a dashboard using 'plotly','dash', 'Visual Studio Code'
****

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/zillow/Metro_time_series.csv"


== Readings and Resources

[NOTE]
====

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
[loweralpha]
.. Following the instruction on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], launch VS Code on Anvil
+
[TIP]
====
- Refer to the section of "How can I launch VS Code on Anvil? Choose the following options:

    - Allocation: "cis220051"
    - CPU Cores: 1
    - Starting Directory: "Home Directory"

- If you get "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder" window pop up, click "Yes, I trust the authors"

====

..  Following the instruction on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], initial Configuration of VS Code, install Python extension for Visual Studio 

.. Following the instruction on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], select Python interpreter path to "/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3"
.. Open a new terminal at visual studio code, show current path for python interpreter 

[TIP]
====
- Refer to "Initial Configuration of VS Code" section to install Python extension
- Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/codeediting[Code Editing in Visual Studio Code] to find out how to edit and run code
- Use the following command to check the path for Python interpreter
[source,python]
----
which python3
----
.output
/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3
====

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a python file in Visual Studio Code, name it "who_am_I.py" , simply to create and display a paragraph of your self-introduction that you may use it at a job interview 
.. Run the file through terminal 

[TIP]
====
- command to run a python file 
[source,python]
python3 who_am_I.py
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
After set up the "Visual studio code", we can use it to create our Dash app. Since we will run our code at anvil, obviously it will not run at the root path or root url ("http:ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu"), we will need to create Prefix Path that nest the Dash app under it. Use the provided code to assemble the Prefix Path
[source,python]
----
import subprocess
import requests
import lxml.html
import socket
import os
import psutil
import yaml
from dash import Dash, html,dcc
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# get the hostname
hostname= subprocess.run("hostname", text=True, capture_output=True).stdout.strip()
 
def is_open(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) != 0

def find_port(start_port, end_port):
    for port in range(start_port, end_port):
        if is_open(port):
            return port
    raise RuntimeError("No open port found")

# Use this function to find an open port
port = find_port(8050, 65535)

vscode_port = yaml.unsafe_load(open(f"/proc/{psutil.Process(psutil.Process(psutil.Process(psutil.Process(os.getpid()).ppid()).ppid()).ppid()).ppid()}/cwd/connection.yml", 'r').read()).get("port")

# assemble prefix
prefix = f"/rnode/{hostname}/{vscode_port}/proxy/{port}/"
----
====
.. Display the prefix string you assembled


=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Now create a Dash app to display your self-introduction online (anvil local hosted webpage)

[TIP]
====
- Read the https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial["dash tutorial"], understand the basic components to create a Dash App.  
- You will need to add additional "requests_pathname_prefix" parameter to `Dash` to specify the URL prefix that the Dash app uses for all its requests. Refer to the following code, modify it if needed
[source, python]
Dash(__name__,request_pathname_prefix = prefix)
- You will need to start the app with "port" parameters, refer to the following code, modify it if needed

app.run(port=port)

- You may start the app with an additional "host" parameter with default value as '0.0.0.0' if you would like to reach the website through all network interface

app.run(host = '0.0.0.0',port=port)
====
 
=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Now please create a dash app to do Project 4 question 2b - "Use a bar chart to visualize the top 5 regions with the youngest inventory of homes"

[TIP]
====
- Read https://dash.plotly.com/layout["Dash Layout"], understand the basic Dash app layout
- If You get "killed " output from the program, it might due to the size of dataset is too large. Try to use chunksize to read in dataset 
[source,python]
pd.read_csv('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/zillow/Metro_time_series.csv',chunksize=10000)
- Use for loop to read each chunk DataFrame and calculate the aggregate value each chunk, then combine and find the top 5 for the whole dataset
