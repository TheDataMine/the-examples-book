= TDM 10100: Project 11 -- 2023
 
**Motivation:** Selecting the right tools, understanding a problem and knowing what is available to support you takes practice. +
So far this semester we have learned multiple tools to use in `R` to help solve a problem. This project will be an opportunity for you to choose the tools and decide how to solve the problem presented. 

We will also be looking at `Time Series` data. This is a way to study the change of one or more variables through time. Data visualizations help greatly in looking at Time Series data. 


Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The project will use the following dataset:

* `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)
Read in the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv` into a data.frame named `orders`

[loweralpha]
.. Convert the `create_date` column to month, date, year format
.. How many unique years are in the data.frame ?
.. Create a line plot that shows the average number of orders placed per day of the week ( e.g. Monday, Tuesday ...). 
.. Write one to two sentences on what you notice in the graph

=== Question 2 ( 2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. Identify the top 5 vendors (vendor_id) with the highest number of orders over the years (based on `created_at` for time reference)
.. For these top 5 vendors, determine the average grand_total amount for the orders they received each year
.. Comment on any interesting patterns you observe, regarding the average total amount across these vendors, and how that changed over the years.

[NOTE]
====
You can use either `tapply` OR the `aggregate` function to group or summarize data
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

.. Using the `create_at` field, try to find out how many orders are placed after 5 pm, and how many orders are placed before 5 pm?
.. Create a bar chart that compares the number of orders placed after 5 pm with the number of orders before 5 pm, for each day of the week

[NOTE]
====
You can use the library `ggplot2` for this question.

You may get more information about ggplot2 from here:  https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org
====
 
=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Looking at the data, is there something that you find interesting? 
Create 3 new graphs, and explain what you see, and why you chose each specific type of plot.
