= TDM 10200: Project 7 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas is a powerful tool to manipulate and analysis data in Python. We can use Pandas to extract information about one or more variables on data frames, sometimes we can group the data according to one variable and summarizing another variable within each of those groups.

**Context:**  Understanding how to use Pandas and be able to develope functions allows for a systematic approach to analyzing data.
**Scope:** Pandas and functions

== Datasets

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
 
[loweralpha]

.. US records start with 'US' in the first field, create a function to get a dictionary with years and count of how many US records pairs in the dataset
.. Run the function for dataset 1950.csv
.. Run the function for datasets from 1950 to 1955(included)

[TIP]
====
- The following sample code can be used to get US records
[source,bash]
----
[source,python]
us_records = df[df['id'].str.startswith('US')]
----
- shape may be useful to get information

====


=== Question 2 (2 points)
.. Sort the dictionary from question 1 in descending order using lambda function as key for sorted function
+
[TIP]
====
- Refer to https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp[Python Lambda]
====
