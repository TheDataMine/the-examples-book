= TDM 10200: Project 7 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas is a powerful tool to manipulate and analysis data in Python. We can use Pandas to extract information about one or more variables on data frames, sometimes we can group the data according to one variable and summarizing another variable within each of those groups.

**Context:**  Understanding how to use Pandas and be able to develope functions allows for a systematic approach to analyzing data.
**Scope:** Pandas and functions

== Datasets

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
 
[loweralpha]

.. US records start with 'US' in the first field, create a function to get a dictionary with years and count of how many US records pairs in the dataset
.. Run the function for dataset 1950.csv
.. Run the function for datasets from 1950 to 1955(included)

[TIP]
====
- The following sample code can be used to get US records
[source,bash]
----
[source,python]
us_records = df[df['id'].str.startswith('US')]
----
- shape may be useful to get information

====


=== Question 2 (2 points)
.. Sort the output dictionary from question 1 in descending order using a Python lambda function as the keyword argument for "key"  in the sorted function
+
[TIP]
====
- Refer to https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp[Python Lambda]
====
.. Modify the function from question 1 to include the sort statement and return the sorted dictionary

=== Question 3(2 points)
 
.. How many snow days ("SNOW" as element_code) are there for dataset 1950.csv in US?
.. How many snow days at each station are there for dataset 1950.csv in Us?
.. How many snow days for different months at each location are there for dataset 1950.csv in Us?


[TIP]
====
- The following statement is the sample to get month information
[source,python]
df['date']=pd.to_datetime(df['date'],format ='%Y%m%d')
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
====

.. How many precipitation records for dataset 1950 in US? 

[TIP]
====
- Group by "element_code" can be useful to get aggregate numbers

====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Which location has the highest average temperature for the whole year?
.. Which location has the most precipitation for the whole year? 

=== Question 4 (2 points)
 

[loweralpha]
.. Create a function for Question 3 a
.. Create a function for Question 3b

 

=== Question 5 (2 points)
 
.. Test your functions from question 4a and 4b for 5 different years
