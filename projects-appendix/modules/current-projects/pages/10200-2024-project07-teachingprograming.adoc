= TDM 10200: Project 7 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas is a powerful tool to manipulate and analysis data in Python. We can use Pandas to extract information about one or more variables on data frames, sometimes we can group the data according to one variable and summarizing another variable within each of those groups.

**Context:**  Understanding how to use Pandas and be able to develope functions allows for a systematic approach to analyzing data.
**Scope:** Pandas and functions
