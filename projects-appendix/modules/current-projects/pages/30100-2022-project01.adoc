= TDM 30100: Project 1 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Itâ€™s been a long summer! Last year, you got some exposure command line tools, SQL, Python, and other fun topics like web scraping. This semester, we will continue to work primarily using Python with data. Topics will include things like: documentation using tools like sphinx, or pdoc, writing tests, sharing Python code using tools like pipenv, poetry, and git, interacting with and writing APIs, as well as containerization. Of course, like nearly every other project, we will be be wrestling with data the entire time.

We will start slowly, however, by learning about Jupyter Lab. This year, instead of using RStudio Server, we will be using Jupyter Lab. In this project we will become familiar with the new environment, review some, and prepare for the rest of the semester.

**Context:** This is the first project of the semester! We will start with some review, and set the "scene" to learn about a variety of useful and exciting topics.

**Scope:** Jupyter Lab, R, Python, Anvil, markdown
