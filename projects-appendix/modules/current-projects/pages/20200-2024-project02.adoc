= TDM 20200: Project 02 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Web scraping is the process of taking content off of the internet. Typically this goes hand-in-hand with parsing or processing the data. In general, scraping data from websites has always been a popular topic in The Data Mine. We will use the website of "books.toscrape.com" to practice scraping skills

**Context:** In the previous project we gently introduced XML and XPath to parse a XML document. In this project, we will introduce web scraping.  We will learn some basic web scraping skills using BeautifulSoup.

**Scope:** Python, web scraping, BeautifulSoup

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand webpage structures
- Use BeautifulSoup to scrape data from web pages

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
 
[loweralpha]
.. Please use BeautifulSoup to get and display the website's HTML source code https://books.toscrape.com[https://books.toscrape.com]
.. Review the website's HTML source code.  What is the title for that webpage?

[TIP]
====
You may refer to the following to import libraries, modify the code to fit into yours
[source,python]
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
...# define url
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content,'html.parser')
====
 
=== Question 2 (2 points)
 
.. Please use the BeautifulSoup library to get and display all categories' names from the homepage of the website.

[TIP]
====
- Review the page source code, find "categories" located at the sidebar under a div tag with class is "nav-list" The BeautifulSoup "select" method is useful to get category, like this:

[source,python]
soup.select('.nav-list li a')
====


=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Now, instead of only getting the names of the categories, get all of the category links from the homepage as well.
+
[TIP]
====
- Review the homepage source code, explore where is the category links locate, You may use "find" to get the "div" section

[source,python]
soup.find('div',class = 'side_categories')

- Under "div" section, the links can be found in the "a" tag. You may use "find_all" to get all category links
[source,python]
find_all('a')

- You may refer to the following code to exclude "books" from the category list since it is not part of the category 
# Assume "link" hold a category link information

[source,python]
link.get('href').startswith("catalogue/category/books/")
 
- Output will look like

----
Category: Travel,link: catalogue/category/books/travel_2/index.html
Category: Mystery,link: catalogue/category/books/mystery_3/index.html
....
----
====

.. Update the code from question 3a to get (only) the links for books with the category of "Romance".

[TIP]
====
- Output will be like 
----
romance_url is https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html
----
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Use the "Romance" link https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html[https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html] from Question 3b to get the webpage source code for the Romance category web page.
.. Display all book titles in the first page of the romance category. 


 
=== Question 5 (2 pts)

If you look at this page:

http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html[http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html]

you can see, in the lower-right-hand corner, that the link to the second page is:

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/page-2.html[https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/page-2.html]

Now temporarily forget that you know this fact!  We want you to try to find this page-2 link in the Romance book page.


.. Starting with http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html[http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html], please find the page 2 link the from Romance category web page using BeautifulSoup.
+
[TIP]
====
The following is some sample code, for your reference.

[source,python]
----
# need to remove last part from basic url
url= "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/romance_8/index.html"
url=url.rsplit('/',1)[0]
# Assume you get next hyperlink ""category/page-2.html" as the next page, you need to only keep the last part 
next_link = next.split("/")[-1]
#Combine
next_url=url+"/"+next_link
----
====
.. List the titles of all of the books from the second page of the "Romance" category.
