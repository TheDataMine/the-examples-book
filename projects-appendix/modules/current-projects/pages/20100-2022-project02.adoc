= TDM 20100: Project 2 -- 2022

**Motivation:** The ability to navigate a shell, like `bash`, and use some of its powerful tools, is very useful. The number of disciplines utilizing data in new ways is ever-growing, and as such, it is very likely that many of you will eventually encounter a scenario where knowing your way around a terminal will be useful. We want to expose you to some of the most useful UNIX tools, help you navigate a filesystem, and even run UNIX tools from within your Jupyter Lab notebook.

**Context:** At this point in time, our Jupyter Lab system, using https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu, is new to some of you, and maybe familiar to others. The comfort with which you each navigate this UNIX-like operating system will vary. In this project we will learn how to use the terminal to navigate a UNIX-like system, experiment with various useful commands, and learn how to execute bash commands from within Jupyter Lab.

**Scope:** bash, Jupyter Lab

.Learning Objectives
****
- Distinguish differences in `/home`, `/anvil/scratch`, and `/anvil/projects/tdm`.
- Navigating UNIX via a terminal: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `.`, `..`, `~`, etc.
- Analyzing file in a UNIX filesystem: `wc`, `du`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, etc.
- Creating and destroying files and folder in UNIX: `scp`, `rm`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, etc.
- Use `man` to read and learn about UNIX utilities.
- Run `bash` commands from within Jupyter Lab.
