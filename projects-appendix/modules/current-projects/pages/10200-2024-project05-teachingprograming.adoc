= TDM 10200: Project 5 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Once we have some data analysis working in Python, we often want to wrap it into a function. Dr Ward usually tests anything that he wrote (usually 5 times), to make sure it works, before wrapping it into a function.  Once we are sure our analysis works, if we wrap it into a function, it can usually be easier to use.


**Context:**  Functions also help us to put our work into bite-size pieces that are easier to understand.  The basic idea is similar to functions from R or from other languages and tools. 

**Scope:** functions

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Write a function called "avg_aggreg_temp" that takes 5 parameters: the file path as string , column_title_list as list for column titles, start date as integer, end date as integer, temperature element code as string and set default value for it as "TAVG".  Outputs a float number of average temperature  
.. Run the function for data set 2018.csv with  different date range 20180101 to 20180115

[NOTE]
====
- Dataset does not include column tile, so column_title_list=["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"]
- Dataset is about 2.2 GB, so use chunksize argument to read in data, set chunksize = 10000
- data type for "value" column is integer. So the start_date and end_date are integers as yyyymmdd
- You will need to include docstring for the function definition
====
  

=== Question 2 (2 points)
 
.. Create a function to display the list of years annual average trend for a specified element code
.. Run the function for year 1880 to 1883

[TIP]
====
- Create a files list to hold the file names for 1880.csv to 1883.csv, like following, you may need to modify sample codes to fit it into your program
[source,python]
files = [f'/{year}.csv for year in range(1880,1884)]
- Include column titles ["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"]
====
 
=== Question 3(2 points)



.. Create a function to display the years' month average trend for a specified element code
.. Run the function for year 1880 to 1883, Jan, May, and October 
 



=== Question 4 (2 points)


.. Create a function to find out the year with most qflags
.. Run the function for year 1880 to 1883, and qflgs value "T"


=== Question 5 (2 points)
.. Explore the files under noaa, create one function your defined. Explain the function purpose and input output , 
.. Run your function for a list of years
