= TDM 20200: Project 03 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Web scraping is the process of taking content off of the internet. Typically this goes hand-in-hand with parsing or processing the data. In general, scraping data from websites has always been a popular topic in The Data Mine. We will use the website of "books.toscrape.com" to practice scraping skills
