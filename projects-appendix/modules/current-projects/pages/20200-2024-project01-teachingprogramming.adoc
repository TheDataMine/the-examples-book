= TDM 20200: Project 1 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Extensible Markup Language or XML is a very important file format for storing structured data. Even though formats like JSON, and csv tend to be more prevalent, many, many legacy systems still use XML, and it remains an appropriate format for storing complex data. In fact, JSON and csv are quickly becoming less relevant as new formats and serialization methods like https://arrow.apache.org/faq/[parquet] and https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[protobufs] are becoming more common.

 
**Context:** In this project we will use the `lxml` package in Python. This is a first project focusing on web scraping
 
**Scope:** python, XML

.Learning objectives
****
- Review and summarize the differences between XML and HTML/CSV.
- Match XML terms to sections of XML demonstrating working knowledge.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/valu.xml`

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
It would be well worth your time to:

. Read https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/data-formats/html[HTML section of the book].
. Read through the https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/data-formats/xml[XML section of the book].
. Finally, take the time to work through https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html[`pandas` 10 minute intro].

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Please use the `lxml` package to find and print the name of the root element's tag for the XML file of valu.xml
 
[NOTE]
====
https://lxml.de [This] link will show you more information about lxml

[TIP]
====
Check out this old project that uses a different dataset -- you may find it useful for this project.

====


=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Please use 'xpath' with namespace to find the 'title' element

[IMPORTANT]
====
you will need to use namespace for xpath method otherwise, you won't get the element
https://lxml.de/xpathxslt.html [This] link will show you more information about XPath with lxml
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Please use 'xpath' with namespace to find and list all child elements directly under the 'document' element in the xml file

.. Please get and list all author elements, including their child elements and attributes
 

[TIP]
====
To print an `Element` object, you may refer to the following sample code. You will need to modify the code for your assignment

[source,python]
----
print(etree.tostring(my_element, pretty_print=True).decode('utf-8'))
----
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Please list all codeSystem attribute values from the file
.. Please list the codeSystem  value that 'displayName' attribute contains string of 'DOSAGE'

[TIP]
====
You can use the `.attrib` attribute to access the attributes of an `Element`. It is a dict-like object, so you can access the attributes similarly to how you would access the values in a dictionary.
