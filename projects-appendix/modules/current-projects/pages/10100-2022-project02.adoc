= TDM 10100: Project 2 -- 2022
Introduction to R part I

The Rfootnote:[R is case sensitive] environment is a powerful tool to perform data analysis. R's language is often compared to Python. Both languages have their advantages and disadvantages, and both are worth learning. 

In this project we will dive in head first and learn some of the basics while solving data-driven problems.


.5 basic types of data
[%collapsible]
====
    * Decimal values like 1.5 are called numerics
    * Whole numbers like 7 are called integers (integers are also numerics.)
    * Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
    * Text (or string) values are called characters.
    * Complex numbers such as   3 + 2ifootnote:[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/complex.html]

[NOTE]
====
R and Python both have their advantages and disadvantages. There still exist domains and problems where R is better than Python, and where Python is better than R. 

In addition, https://julialang.org/[Julia] is another language in this domain that is quickly gaining popularity for its speed and Python-like ease of use.
====

**Context:** In the last project we set the stage for the rest of the semester. We got some familiarity with our project templates, and modified and ran some R code. 

In this project, we will continue to use R within Jupyter Lab to solve problems. Soon, you will see how powerful R is and why it is often more effective than using spreadsheets as a tool for data analysis.

**Scope:** xref:programming-languges:R:introduction[r], xref:programming-languges:R:lists-and-vectors[vectors, lists], indexing

.Learning Objectives
****
- Be aware of the different concepts and when to apply them; such as lists, vectors, factors, and data.frames 

- Be able to explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Read and write basic (csv) data using R.
- Identify good and bad aspects of simple plots.

****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):
[source,python]
----
- myDF<- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
----
== ONE


The data that we may be working with does not always come to us neat and cleanfootnote:["Raw data" vs "Clean data". Some datasets require "cleaning" such as removing duplicates, removing null values and disgarding irrelevent data]. It is important to get a good understanding of the dataset(s) with which you are working. This is the best first step to help solve any data-driven problems.


We are going to use the `read.cv` function to load our datasets into a dataframe named ....

Datasets can be thought or as one or more observations  of one or more variables. For most datasets each row is an observation and each column is a variable.(Unfortunately there are some unique datasets that do not follow convention).
====

We want to use functions such as `head` `tail`, `dimensions`, `summary`, `str` to get a better understanding of our dataframe(DF). 

.Helpful Hints
[%collapsible]
====
[source, python]
----
#looks at the head of the dataframe
head(myDF)
#looks at the tail of the dataframe
tail(myDF)
#returns the type of data in the dataframe
typeof(myDF)

The following code creates a new vectorfootnote:[https://sudo-labs.github.io/r-data-science/vectors/] from the your chosen column.

A vector is a simple way to store data. The data can be numeric data, logical data etc.

.. What type of data is in this vector?

Indexing

.Insider Knowlege
[%collapsible]
====
Accessing data can be done in many ways, one of those ways is called **_indexing_**. Typically we use brackets **[ ]** when indexing. By doing this we can select or even exclude specific elements. For example we can select a specific column and a certian range within the column. Some examples of symbols to help us select elements include: +
     * < less than +
     * > greater than +
     * <= less than or equal to +
     * >= greater than or equal to +
     * == is equal +
     * != is not equal +
Also important to note that indexing in R begins at 1 (This means that the first row of the dataframe will start at 1).

#and/or
#creates a new vector with the specific inf
myDF2 <- myDF$columnnames
#selects all rows in column chosen

#puts all variables that are less than 6 from the dataframe
myDF2 = myDF[myDF > 6]

Vectors and Lists +

Vectors are one-dimensional and typically atomic vectors are homogeneous.  They can easily be converted into other types. This is called `coercion` +

Technically speaking lists are vectors. Lists are `recursive` this means that they can contain values of different types. Lists are typically used if we need to hold somthing that has an atom length of greater than 1 or if the atoms are different data types +

R is case-sensitive language. This means that we need to be aware of what we are putting into each cell. It is critical to follow column names and capatalizations when attempting to access information. 
[source,python]
----
vec<- c(1,2,3)
Vec<- c(3,2,1) #note the capital "V" in the variable name
print(vec) #will print: 1,2,3
print(Vec) # will print: 3,2,1

The hierarchy of data types is +

Basic graph types are helpful to visualizing data. They can be an important tool in discovering insights into the data you are working with.  +
R has a number of tools built in for basic graphs such as scatter plots, bar charts, histograms etc.

.Insider Knowlege
[%collapsible]
====
A dot plot also known as a dot chart, is similar to a bar chart or a scatter plot. In R each catagory is the vertical axis and the corresponding value is in the horizontal axis. +

We can assign groups a color to help differentiate while plotting a dot chart +

We can also plot a column that we find interesting as well to take a look at what the data might show us.
For example if we wanted to see if there was a difference in days of the week and number of flights, we would use hist()
[source,python]
----
weekdays<- myDF$DAY_OF_WEEK 
hist(weekdays)
