= TDM 10100: Project 2 -- 2022
Introduction to R part I

The Rfootnote:[R is case sensitive] environment is a powerful tool to perform data analysis. R's language is often compared to Python. Both languages have their advantages and disadvantages, and both are worth learning. 

In this project we will dive in head first and learn some of the basics while solving data-driven problems.


.5 basic types of data
[%collapsible]
====
    * Decimal values like 1.5 are called numerics
    * Whole numbers like 7 are called integers (integers are also numerics.)
    * Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
    * Text (or string) values are called characters.
    * Complex numbers such as   3 + 2ifootnote:[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/complex.html]

[NOTE]
====
R and Python both have their advantages and disadvantages. There still exist domains and problems where R is better than Python, and where Python is better than R. 

In addition, https://julialang.org/[Julia] is another language in this domain that is quickly gaining popularity for its speed and Python-like ease of use.

**Context:** In the last project we set the stage for the rest of the semester. We got some familiarity with our project templates, and modified and ran some R code. 

In this project, we will continue to use R within Jupyter Lab to solve problems. Soon, you will see how powerful R is and why it is often more effective than using spreadsheets as a tool for data analysis.

**Scope:** r, vectors, indexing, recycling

.Learning Objectives
****
- Be aware of the different concepts and when to apply them; such as lists, vectors, factors, and data.frames 

- Be able to explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Read and write basic (csv) data using R.
- Identify good and bad aspects of simple plots.
- Understandthe concept of "recycling" in R and predict behavior of provided statements.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data`

== ONE

The data that we may be working with does not always come to us neat and clean. It is important to get a good understanding of the dataset(s) with which you are working. This is the best first step to help solve any data-driven problems.


We are going to use the `read.cv` function to load our datasets into a dataframe named ....

We want to use functions such as `head` `tail`, `dimensions`, `summary`, `str` to get a better understanding of our dataframe(DF).

   A vector is a simple way to store data. The data can be numeric data, logical data etc.

== THREE
Indexing.......

====

.Insider Knowlege
[%collapsible]
====
Accessing data can be done in many ways, one of those ways is called **_indexing_**. Typically we use brackets **[ ]** when indexing. By doing this we can select or even exclude specific elements. For example we can select a specific column and a certian range within the column. Some examples of symbols to help us select elements include: +
     * < less than +
     * > greater than +
     * <= less than or equal to +
     * >= greater than or equal to +
     * == is equal +
     * != is not equal +

== FOUR
Recycling...


.Insider Knowlege
[%collapsible]
====
Also known as vector recycling. Adding vectors requires both vectors to be the same length. +
If one vector is shorter in length than another, R will automatically repeat the elements of the shorter vector until the same number of elements has been met. 

====

 Example:
    a <- c(5,10,15,20,25,30)
    b <- c(1,3,5)
    result <- a + b
    *b will become c(1,3,5,1,3,5) to match the length of vector a

Dot Plots....


.Insider Knowlege
[%collapsible]
====
Also known as a dot chart, is similar to a bar chart or a scatter plot. In R each catagory is the vertical axis and the corresponding value is in the horizontal axis. +

We can assign groups a color to help differentiate while plotting a dot chart....
