= TDM 40100: Project 4 -- 2022

**Motivation:** The ability to use SQL to query data in a relational database is an extremely useful skill. What is even more useful is the ability to build a `sqlite3` database, design a schema, insert data, create indexes, etc. This series of projects is focused around SQL, `sqlite3`, with the opportunity to use other skills you've built throughout the previous years.

**Context:** In TDM 20100 (formerly STAT 29000), you had the opportunity to learn some basics of SQL, and likely worked (at least partially) with `sqlite3` -- a powerful database engine. In this project (and following projects), we will branch into SQL and `sqlite3`-specific topics and techniques that you haven't yet had exposure to in The Data Mine.

**Scope:** `sqlite3`, lmod, SQL

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create your own sqlite3 database file.
- Analyze a large dataset and formulate CREATE TABLE statements designed to store the data.
- Run one or more queries to test out the end result.
- Demonstrate the ability to normalize a series of database tables.
- Wrangle and insert data into database.
****

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_book_authors.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_book_series.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_books.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_reviews_dedup.json`

== Questions

This project is going to be a bit more open. The goal of this project is to take our dataset sample, and write Python code to insert it into our `sqlite3` database. There are a variety of ways this could be accomplished, and we will accept anything that works, with a few constraints.

In the next project, we will run some experiments that will time insertion, project the time it would take to insert all of the data, adjust database settings, and, ultimately, create a final product that we can feel good about.

=== Question 1

As mentioned earlier -- the goal of this project is to insert the sample data into our database. Start by generating the sample data.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

rm -rf $HOME/goodreads_samples
mkdir $HOME/goodreads_samples
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_book_authors.json $HOME/goodreads_samples/
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_book_series.json $HOME/goodreads_samples/
shuf -n 27450 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_books.json > $HOME/goodreads_samples/goodreads_books.json
shuf -n 98375 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_reviews_dedup.json > $HOME/goodreads_samples/goodreads_reviews_dedup.json
----

In addition, go ahead and copy our empty database that is ready for you to insert data into.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

rm $HOME/my.db
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/my.db $HOME
----

You can run this as many times as you need in order to get a fresh start.

- Output from running the code.

=== Question 2

Write Python code that inserts the data into your database. Here are the constraints.

. You should be able to fully recover the `book_cover` image from the database. This means you'll need to handle scraping the `image_url` and converting the image to `bytes` before inserting into the database.
+
[TIP]
====
Want some help to write the scraping code? Check out https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/30100-2022-project04#question-2[this 30100 question] for more guidance.
====
+
. Your functions and code should ultimately operate on a single _row_ of the datasets. For instance:
+
[NOTE]
====
[source,python]
----
import json

with open("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_books.json") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
        parsed = json.loads(line)
        print(f"{parsed['isbn']=}")
        print(f"{parsed['num_pages']=}")
        break
----
====
+
Here, you can see that we can take a single row and do _something_ to it. Why do we want it to work this way? This makes it easy to break our dataset into chunks and perform operations in parallel, if we so choose (and we will, but not in this project).

=== Question 3

Demonstrate your database works by doing the following.

. Fully recover a `book_cover` and display it in your notebook.

%%bash

rm $HOME/test.db || true
sqlite3 $HOME/test.db "CREATE TABLE test (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	my_blob BLOB
);"

import shutil
import requests
import os
import uuid
import sqlite3

url = 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1310220028m/5333265.jpg'
my_bytes = scrape_image_from_url(url)

# insert
conn = sqlite3.connect('/home/x-kamstut/test.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
query = f"INSERT INTO test (my_blob) VALUES (?);"
dat = (my_bytes,)
cursor.execute(query, dat)
conn.commit()
cursor.close()

# retrieve
conn = sqlite3.connect('/home/x-kamstut/test.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

query = f"SELECT * from test where id = ?;"
cursor.execute(query, (1,))
record = cursor.fetchall()
img = record[0][1]
tmp_filename = str(uuid.uuid4())
with open(f"{tmp_filename}.jpg", 'wb') as file:
    file.write(img)
    
from IPython import display
display.Image(f"{tmp_filename}.jpg")
----
====
+
. Run a simple query to `SELECT` the first 5 rows of each table.

[NOTE]

[source,ipython]
----
%sql sqlite:////home/my-username/my.db
----

[source,ipython]
----
%%sql

SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 5;

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to replace "my-username" with your Anvil username, for example, x-kamstut is mine.
