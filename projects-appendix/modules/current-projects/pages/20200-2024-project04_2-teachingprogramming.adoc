= TDM 20200: Project 4 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is a skill that is invaluable in many fields. It can be pretty fun too! In this project, we are going to dive into plotting using "plotly" of Python version, a very popular open source graphing library that can interact graphs online.

**Context:** Create good visualizations about housing data using "plotly". In the next project, we will continue to learn about and become comfortable using `plotly`.

**Scope:** Python, visualizations, plotly

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
- Demonstrate the ability to customize a plot (color, shape/linetype).

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/zillow/Metro_time_series.csv"


== Readings and Resources

[NOTE]
====
- Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].
- You may refer to https://plot.ly/python[plot introduction]
- Read plotly express functions on https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/[this] page.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
[loweralpha]
.. Read in the data and called it "df"
.. Update column "Date" to the "datetime" data type, plot a line chart to show the overall housing inventory through year "2010" to "2015"

[TIP]
====
- "to_datetime()" is useful to convert the data type
====

=== Question 2(2 points)

.. Use a bar chart to visualize the top 5 regions with the highest inventory of homes. 
.. Use a bar chart to visualize the top 5 regions with the oldest inventory of homes

[TIP]
====
- Explore the dataset, "United_State" should be excluded from the RegionName
- "groupby()" and "mean()" are useful to get the average values
- "sort_value()" is useful to sort data in order
- You may use "reset_index()" to put the column back to regular from index 
====
 
=== Question 3(2 points)

.. Use a box plot to visualize the the top 5 regions with the oldest inventory of homes

[TIP]
====
- You may refer to box plot session in the https://plot.ly/python[plot introduction]
====

=== Question 4(2 points)

.. Use scatter plot to visualize the top 20 regions that have the highest median percentage of price reduction for all homes, have x-axis ordered by "RegionName"

[TIP]
====
- "groupby" and "median()" are useful to get median values
- You may refer to scatter plot session in the https://plot.ly/python[plot introduction]
====
=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Now that you've been exploring data visualization using several types of plots, it's important to understand the appropriate plots to use. Please describe your understanding that in which these different types of plots are most effectively utilized.
