= TDM 20100: Project 6 -- 2022

**Motivation:** `awk` is a programming language designed for text processing. It can be a quick and efficient way to quickly parse through and process textual data. While Python and R definitely have their place in the data science world, it can be extremely satisfying to perform an operation extremely quickly using something like `awk`. 

**Context:** This is the second of three projects where we introduce `awk`. `awk` is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of the tasks that we've previously used other UNIX utilities for. After this project, we will continue to utilize all of the utilities, and bash scripts, to perform tasks in a repeatable manner.

**Scope:** awk, UNIX utilities

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use awk to process and manipulate textual data.
- Use piping and redirection within the terminal to pass around data between utilities.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles_clean.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/donerschoose/Donations.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/weather.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1

Use `awk` to determine how many columns and rows are in the following dataset: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles_clean.csv`.

Make sure the output is formatted as follows.

.output
----
rows: 12345
columns: 12345
----

.Items to submit

- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.

=== Question 2

What are the possible "conditions" of the vehicles being sold: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles_clean.csv`? Use `awk` to answer this question. How many cars of each condition are in the dataset? Make sure to format the output as follows.

.output
----
Condition Number of cars
--------- --------------
AAA       12345
bb        99999
----

=== Question 3

Use `awk` to determine the years (for example, 2020, 2021, etc) of the donations in the dataset: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/donerschoose/Donations.csv`?

[TIP]
====
The https://thomas-cokelaer.info/blog/2011/05/awk-the-substr-command-to-select-a-substring/[`substr`] function in `awk` will be useful.

=== Question 4

Use `awk` to determine the total donations (in dollars) by year: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/donerschoose/Donations.csv`?

Use `printf` and the unix `column` utility to format the output as follows.

.output
----
Year Donations in dollars
2020 $1234.56
2021 $9999.99
----

=== Question 5

Use `awk` to determine the average `temperature_high` by month: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/weather.csv`. Make sure the output is sorted by month (you can use `sort` for that). If you are feeling adventurous, try and use `awk` to output a horizontal bar plot using just ascii and `awk`. This last part is _not_ required, but could be fun.
