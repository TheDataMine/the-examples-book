= STAT 19000: Project 4 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** Up until this point we've utilized bits and pieces of the pandas library to perform various tasks. In this project we will formally introduce pandas and numpy, and utilize their capabilities to solve data-driven problems. 

**Context:** By now you'll have had some limited exposure to pandas. This is the first in a three project series that covers some of the main components of both the numpy and pandas libraries. We will take a two project intermission to learn about functions, and then continue. 

**Scope:** python, pandas

.Learning Objectives
****
- Distinguish the differences between numpy, pandas, DataFrames, Series, and ndarrays.
- Use numpy, scipy, and pandas to solve a variety of data-driven problems.
- Demonstrate the ability to read and write data of various formats using various packages.
- View and access data inside DataFrames, Series, and ndarrays. 
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

The following is an example showing how to time creating a dictionary in two different ways.

[source,python]
----
from block_timer.timer import Timer

with Timer(title="Using dict to declare a dict") as t1:
    my_dict = dict()

with Timer(title="Using {} to declare a dict") as t2:
    my_dict = {}

# or if you need more fine-tuned values
print(t1.elapsed)
print(t2.elapsed)
----

There are a variety of ways to store, read, and write data. The most common is probably still `csv` data. `csv` data is simple, and easy to understand, however, it is a horrible format to read, write, and store. It is slow to read. It is slow to write. It takes up a lot of space.

Luckily, there are some other great options!

Check out the `pandas` documentation showing the various methods used to read and write data: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/io.html

Read in the `2021.csv` file into a `pandas` DataFrame called `my_df`. Use the `Timer` to time writing `my_df` out to `/scratch/brown/ALIAS/2021.csv`, `/scratch/brown/ALIAS/2021.parquet`, and `/scratch/brown/ALIAS/2021.feather`. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to replace "ALIAS" with your purdue alias.
====

Use f-strings to print how much faster writing the `parquet` format was than the `csv` format, as a percentage.

Use f-strings to print how much faster writing the `feather` format was than the `csv` format, as a percentage.

You should now have 3 files in your `$SCRATCH` directory: `2021.csv`, `2021.parquet`, and `2021.feather`.

Use the `Timer` to time reading in the `2021.csv`, `2021.feather`, and `2021.parquet` files into `pandas` DataFrames called `my_df`.

Use f-strings to print how much faster reading the `parquet` format was than the `csv` format, as a percentage.

Use f-strings to print how much faster reading the `feather` format was than the `csv` format, as a percentage.

Round percentages to 1 decimal place. See https://miguendes.me/73-examples-to-help-you-master-pythons-f-strings#how-to-format-a-number-as-percentage[here] for examples on how to do this using f-strings.

Finally, how much space does each file take up? Use f-strings to print the size in MB.

[TIP]
====
There are a couple of options on how to get file size, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2104080/how-can-i-check-file-size-in-python[here].

If you haven't already, please check out and walk through the https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#[10 minute intro to pandas]. It is a really great way to get started using `pandas`.

Also, check out xref:book:python:pandas-indexing.adoc[this] and https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html[this].

A _method_ is a function that is associated with a particular class. For example, `mean` is a method of the `pandas` DataFrame object.

[source,python]
----
# myDF is an object of class DataFrame
# mean is a method of the DataFrame class
myDF.mean()
----

Typically, when using `pandas`, you will be working with either a DataFrame or a Series. The DataFrame class is what you would normally think of when you think about a data frame. A Series is essentially 1 column or row of data. In `pandas`, both Series and DataFrames have _methods_ that perform various operations.

Use indexing and the `value_counts` method to get and print the count of `Gender` for survey respondents from Indiana. 

Next, use the `plot` method to generate a plot. Use the `rot` option of the `plot` method to rotate the x-labels so they are displayed vertically.

Let's figure out whether or not `YearsCode` is associated with `ConvertedCompYearly`. Get an array of unique values for the `YearsCode` column. As you will notice, there are some options that are not numeric values! In fact, when we read in the data, because of these values ("Less than 1 year", "More than 50 years", etc.), `pandas` was unable to choose an appropriate data type for that column of data, and set it to "Object". Use the following code to convert the column to a string.

[source,python]
----
my_df['YearsCode'] = my_df['YearsCode'].astype("str")
----

Great! Now that column contains strings. Use the `replace` method with `regex=True` to replace all non numeric values with nothing!

[source,python]
----
my_df["YearsCode"] = my_df['YearsCode'].replace("[^0-9]", "", regex=True)
----

Next, use the `astype` method to convert the column to "int64".

Finally, use the `plot` method to plot the `YearsCode` on the x-axis and `ConvertedCompYearly` on the y-axis. Use the `kind` argument to make it a "scatter" plot and set the `logy=True`, so large salaries don't ruin our plot.

Write 1-2 sentences with any observations you may have.

Check out the `LanguageHaveWorkedWith` column. It contains a semi-colon separated list of languages that the respondent has worked with. Pretty cool. 

How many times is each language listed? If you get stuck, refer to the hints below. What languages have you worked with from this list?

[TIP]
====
You can start by converting the column to strings.

[source,python]
----
my_df['LanguageHaveWorkedWith'] = my_df['LanguageHaveWorkedWith'].astype(str)
----
====

[TIP]
====
This function can be used to "flatten" a list of lists. 

[source,python]
----
def flatten(t):
    return [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]

flatten([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
----

.Output
----
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
----
====

[TIP]
====
You can apply any of the https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp[Python string methods] to an entire column of strings in `pandas`. For example, I could replace every instance of "hello" with nothing as follows.

[source,python]
----
myDF['some_column_of_strings'].str.replace("hello", "")
----
====

[TIP]
====
Check out the `split` string method.
====

[TIP]
====
You could use a dict to count each of the languages, _or_, since this is a `pandas` project, you could convert the list to a `pandas` Series and use the `value_counts` method!

`pandas` really helps out when it comes to working with data in Python. This is a really cool dataset, use your newfound skills to do a mini-analysis. Your mini-analysis should include 1 or more graphics, along with some interesting observation you made while exploring the data.
