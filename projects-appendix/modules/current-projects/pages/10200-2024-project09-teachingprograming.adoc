= TDM 10200: Project 9 -- Spring 2024


**Motivation:** Working in pandas can be fun! Learning how to wrangle data and clean up data in pandas is a helpful tool to have in your tool belt!  

**Context:** Now that we are feeling more comfortable with building functions and using pandas we want to continue to build skills and use pandas to solve data driven problems.

**Scope:** python, pandas, numpy
