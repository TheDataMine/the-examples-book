= STAT 29000: Project 14 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** Rearranging data to and from "long" and "wide" formats _sounds_ like a difficult task, however, `tidyverse` has a variety of function that make it easy. 

**Context:** This is the last project for the course. This project has a focus on how data can change when grouped differently, and using the `pivot` functions.

**Scope:** R, tidyverse, ggplot

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use mutate, pivot, unite, filter, and arrange to wrangle data and solve data-driven problems.
- Combine different data using joins (left_join, right_join, semi_join, anti_join), and bind_rows.
- Group data and calculate aggregated statistics using group_by, mutate, summarize, and transform functions.
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings, in ggplot.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1

Calculate the average age of death for each of the `MaritalStatus` values and create a `barplot` using `ggplot` and `geom_col`.

====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 2

Now, let's further group our data by `Sex` to see how the patterns change (if at all). Create a side-by-side bar plot where `Sex` is shown for each of the 5 `MaritalStatus` values.

=== Question 3

In the previous question, before you piped the data into `ggplot` functions, you likely used `group_by` and `summarize`. Take, for example, the following.

[source,r]
----
dat %>%
    group_by(MaritalStatus, Sex) %>%
    summarize(age_of_death=mean(Age)) 
----

.output
----
MaritalStatus	Sex	age_of_death
<chr>	<chr>	<dbl>
D	F	70.34766
D	M	65.60564
M	F	69.81002
M	M	73.05787
S	F	56.83075
S	M	49.12891
U	F	80.80274
U	M	80.27476
W	F	85.69817
W	M	83.98783
----

Is this data "long" or "wide"? 

There are multiple ways we could make this data "wider". Let's say, for example, we want to rearrange the data so that we have the `MaritalStatus` column, a `M` column, and `F` column. The `M` column contains the average age of death for males and the `F` column the same for females. While this may sound complicated to do, `pivot_wider` makes this very easy.

Use `pivot_wider` to rearrange the data as described.

=== Question 4

Create a ggplot plot for each month. Each plot should be a barplot with the `as.factor(DayOfWeekOfDeath)` on the x-axis and the count on the y-axis. The code below provides some structure to help get you started.

[source,r]
----
g <- list() # to save plots to
for (i in 1:12) {
    g[[i]] <- dat %>%
        filter(...) %>%
        ggplot() +
        geom_bar(...)
}

library(patchwork)
library(repr)

# change plot size to 12 by 12
options(repr.plot.width=12, repr.plot.height=12)

# use patchwork to display all plots in a grid
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/vignettes/patchwork.html

=== Question 5

Question 4 is a bit tedious. `tidyverse` provides a _much_ more ergonomic way to create plots like this. Use https://thedatamine.github.io/the-examples-book/r.html#r-facet_wrap[`facet_wrap`] to create the same plot. 

[TIP]
====
You do _not_ need to use a loop to solve this problem anymore. In face, you only need to add 1 more line of code to this part.

[source,r]
----
dat %>%
    filter(....) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(...) +
    # new stuff here

Are there any patterns in the data that you find interesting?
