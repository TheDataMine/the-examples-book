= TDM 10100: Project 14 -- Fall 2023

**Motivation:** We covered a _lot_ this year! When dealing with data driven projects, it is crucial to thoroughly explore the data, and answer different questions to get a feel for it. There are always different ways one can go about this. Proper preparation prevents poor performance. As this is our final project for the semester, its primary purpose is survey based. You will answer a few questions mostly by revisiting the projects you have completed.

**Context:** We are on the last project where we will revisit our previous work to consolidate our learning and insights. This reflection also help us to set our expectations for the upcoming semester

**Scope:** R, Jupyter Lab, Anvil
