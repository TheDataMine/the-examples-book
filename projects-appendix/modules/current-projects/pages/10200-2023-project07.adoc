= TDM 10200: Project 7 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Pandas allows us to work with data frames.  The actions that we perform on data frames will sometimes remind us of similar actions that we have performed on data frames during the previous semester with R.  For instance, we often want to extract information about one or more variables, sometimes grouping the data according to one variable and summarizing another variable within each of those groups.

**Context:**  Unifying our understanding of Pandas and the ability to develop functions will allow us to systematically analyze data.

**Scope:** Pandas and functions

Make sure to have 2 cores when you start your Jupyter Lab session.

For convenience, we will help you quickly get all of the data for all of the flights that depart or arrive at Indianapolis airport, as follows.  Make a new cell in JupyterLab that has exactly this content (please copy and paste for accuracy):

[source,bash]
----
%%bash
head -n1 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1987.csv >~/INDflights.csv
grep -h ",IND," /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/*.csv >>~/INDflights.csv
----

We want to use Pandas to read in the data frame, and it will have a lot of columns.  So we set Pandas to display an unlimited number of columns.

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
----

Afterwards, in a separate cell in JupyterLab, you can read in your data to a Pandas data frame like this:

[source,python]
----
myDF = pd.read_csv('~/INDflights.csv')
----

Do not worry that you get a `DtypeWarning`; this will not affect our work on this project~

Now your data frame called `myDF` will contain all of the data for the flights (from October 1987 to April 2008) that depart or arrive at Indianapolis airport, which has 3-letter code `IND`.

These files correspond to the years 1987 through 2008.  Your data frame should contain all of the data for all of the flights with `IND` as the `Origin` or `Dest` airport.

[loweralpha]
.. How many flights are there altogether in `myDF`?  You can check this using `myDF.shape`.
.. How many of the flights are departing from `IND`?  (I.e., the `Origin` airport is `IND`.)
.. How many of the flights are arriving to `IND`?  (I.e., the `Dest` airport is `IND`.)

.. For flights departing from 'IND' (i.e., with `IND` as the `Origin`), what are the 20 most popular destination airports (i.e., the 20 most popular `Dest` airports)?
.. For flights departing from 'IND' (i.e., with `IND` as the `Origin`), what are the 5 most popular airlines (i.e., the 5 most popular `UniqueCarrier`s)?

Test your functions from question 3a and 3b on a couple of other airports.  Hint:  If we use huge airports, we likely will not have enough member in Pandas and our kernel might crash.  So we will consider some midsize airports for testing the functions.  Test your functions from questions 3a and 3b on Jacksonville (`JAX`) and Buffalo (`BUF`).
