Creating functions and using tapply and sapply

**Motivation:**  As we have learned functions are foundational to more complex programs and behaviors. +
There is an entire programming paradigm based on functions called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming[functional programming].

**Context:** 
We will apply functions to entire vectors of data using `sapply`. We learned how to create functions, and now the next step we will take is to use it on a series of data. `sapply` is one of the best ways to do this in `R`. 

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

* /anvil/projects/tdm/data/okcupid/filtered/users.csv
* /anvil/projects/tdm/data/okcupid/filtered/questions.csv

====
read.csv() function automatically delineates by a comma`,` +
You can use other delimiters by using adding the `sep` argument +
i.e. `read.csv(...sep=';')` +

Use the `readlines(...,n=x)` function to see the first x number of rows to identify what the character that you will use in the `sep` argument.

We want to go ahead and load the datasets into data.frames named `users` and `questions`. Take a look at both data.frames and identify what is a part of each of them. What information is in each datatset, and how they are related?

Simply put, `grep` helps us to find a word within a string. In `R` `grep` is vectorized and can be applied to an entire vector of strings. We will use it to find the any questions that mention `google` in the data.frame `questions`.
[loweralpha]
.. What do you notice if you just use the function `grep()` and create a new variable google and then print that variable?

.. Now that you know the row number, how can you take a look at the information there?

(Bonus question: can find a shortcut to steps a & b?)

https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/grep[*grep*] - `grep()` is a function in `R` that is used to search for matches of a pattern within each element of a string. 
[source,r]
----
grep(pattern, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE, value = FALSE,
     fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE, invert = FALSE)

grepl(pattern, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE,
      fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)

Just an FYI refresh: +

* `<-` is an assignment operator, it assigns values to a variable

* Functions *must* be called using the round brackets aka parenthesis *`()`* 

* Square brackets *`[]`*, are also called `extraction operators` as they are used to help extract specific elements from a vector or matrix.

.. Using the row from our previous question, which variable does this correspond with in the data.frame `users`? 

.. Knowing that the two possible answers are "No. Why spoil the mystery?" and "Yes, Knowledge is power!" What percentage of users do *NOT* google someone before the first date?


.Helpful Hint

====
* Row 2172 in `questions` corresponds to column named `q170849` in `users`

* The `table()` function can be used to quickly create frequency tables 

* The `prop.table()` function can calculate the value of each cell in a table as a proportion of all values.

Using the ability to create a function *AND* `tapply` find the percentages of Female vs Male (Man vs Woman, as categorized in the users data.frame) who *DO* google someone before their date.

Using the ability to create a function *AND* use `sapply()` write a function that takes the string and removes everything after/including the _ from the `gender_orientation` column in the `users` data.frame.

meaning that Hetero_male -> Hetero, we want to do this for the entire column `gender_orientation`

Sapply()- allows you to iterate over a list or vector _without_ the need to use a for loop which is typically a slow way to work in `R`. 

Remember the difference +
(a `very` brief summary of each)

* A vector is the basic data structure in `R` they typically are atomic vectors and lists and have three common properties 
    * Type- typeof()
    * Length- length()
    * Attributes- attributes() 
They are different due to the type of elements they hold. All elements in an atomic vector must be the same(they are also always "flat"), but elements of a list can be different types. 
construction of lists are done by using the function `list()`. The construction of atomic vectors are done by using the function `c()`.
You can determine specific type by using functions like *is.character(), is.double(), is.integer(), is.logical()* 

* A matrix is a two-dimensional; rows and columns and all cells must be the same type. Can be created with the function `matrix()`. 

* An array can be one dimension multi-dimensional. An array with one dimension is similar (but not exact) as a vector. An array with two dimensions is similar (but not exact) as a matrix. An array with three or more dimensions is an n-dimensional array. can be created with the function `array()`.

* A data frame is like a table, or like a matrix, *BUT* the columns can hold different types of data.
