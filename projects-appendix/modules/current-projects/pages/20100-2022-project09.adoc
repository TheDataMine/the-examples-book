= TDM 20100: Project 9 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Although SQL syntax may still feel unnatural and foreign, with more practice it will start to make more sense. The ability to read and write SQL queries is a "bread-and-butter" skill for anyone working with data.

**Context:** We are in the second of a series of projects that focus on learning the basics of SQL. In this project, we will continue to harden our understanding of SQL syntax, and introduce common SQL functions like `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

**Scope:** SQL, sqlite

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a database over a tool like a spreadsheet.
- Describe basic database concepts like: rdbms, tables, indexes, fields, query, clause.
- Basic clauses: select, order by, limit, desc, asc, count, where, from, etc.
- Utilize SQL functions like min, max, avg, sum, and count to solve data-driven problems.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/taxi/taxi_sample.db`

== Questions

=== Question 1

In previous projects, we used `awk` to parse through and summarize data. While `awk` is extremely convenient and can work well, but SQL is even better.

Write a query that will return the `fare_amount`, `surcharge`, `tip_amount`, and `tolls_amount` as a percentage of `total_amount`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to limit the output to only 100 rows! Use the `LIMIT` clause to do this.
====

[TIP]
====
Use the `sum` aggregate function to calculate the totals, and division to figure out the percentages.
====

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.

=== Question 2

++++

Check out the `payment_type` column. Write a query that counts the number of each type of `payment_type`. The end result should print something like the following.

.Output sample
----
payment_type, count
CASH, 123
----

[TIP]
====
You can use aliasing to control the output header names.
====

Write a query that sums the `total_amount` for `payment_type` of "CASH". What is the total amount of cash payments?

++++

Write a query that gets the largest number of passengers in a single trip. How far was the trip? What was the total amount? Answer all of this in a single query.

Whoa, there must be some erroneous data in the database! Not too surprising. Write a query that explores this more, explain what your query does and how it helps you understand what is going on. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure all queries limit output to only 100 rows.

++++

Write a query that gets the average `total_amount` for each year in the database. Which year has the largest average `total_amount`? Use the `pickup_datetime` column to determine the year.

[TIP]
====
Read https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html[this] page and look at the strftime function.
====

[TIP]
====
If you want the headers to be more descriptive, you can use aliases.

=== Question 5

++++
<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_tjope0og?wid=_983291"></iframe>
++++

What percent of data in our database has information on the _location_ of pickup and dropoff? Examine the data, to see if there is a pattern to the rows _with_ that information and _without_ that information.

[TIP]
====
There _is_ a distinct pattern. Pay attention to the date and time of the data.
====

Confirm your hypothesis with the original data set(s) (in `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/taxi/yellow/*.csv`), using bash. This doesn't have to be anything more thorough than running a simple `head` command with a 1-2 sentence explanation.

[TIP]
====
Of course, there will probably be some erroneous data for the latitude and longitude columns. However, you could use the `avg` function on a latitude or longitude column, by _year_ to maybe get a pattern.

[WARNING]
====
_Please_ make sure to double check that your submission is complete, and contains all of your code and output before submitting. If you are on a spotty internet connection, it is recommended to download your submission after submitting it to make sure what you _think_ you submitted, was what you _actually_ submitted.
