= TDM 40100: Project 3 -- 2022

**Motivation:** The ability to use SQL to query data in a relational database is an extremely useful skill. What is even more useful is the ability to build a `sqlite3` database, design a schema, insert data, create indexes, etc. This series of projects is focused around SQL, `sqlite3`, with the opportunity to use other skills you've built throughout the previous years.

**Context:** In TDM 20100 (formerly STAT 29000), you had the opportunity to learn some basics of SQL, and likely worked (at least partially) with `sqlite3` -- a powerful database engine. In this project (and following projects), we will branch into SQL and `sqlite3`-specific topics and techniques that you haven't yet had exposure to in The Data Mine.

**Scope:** `sqlite3`, lmod, SQL
 
.Learning Objectives
****
- Create your own `sqlite3` database file.
- Analyze a large dataset and formulate `CREATE TABLE` statements designed to store the data.
- Run one or more queries to test out the end result.
- Demonstrate the ability to normalize a series of database tables.
- Wrangle and insert data into database.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_book_authors.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_book_series.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/goodreads_books.json`

== Questions

In case you skipped the previous project, let's all get on the same page. You run the following code in a Jupyter notebook to create a `sqlite3` database called `my.db` in your `$HOME` directory.

=== Question 1

Update your original `CREATE TABLE` statement for the `books` table to include a field that will be used to store the actual book cover images from the `image_url` field in the `books` table. Call this new field `book_cover`. Which one of the `sqlite` types did you use?

Recall that in the previous project, we just ignored the following fields from the `books` table: `series`, `similar_books`, `popular_shelves`, and `authors`. We did this because those fields are more complicated to deal with.

Read https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/access/database-normalization-description[this] article on database normalization from Microsoft. We are going to do our best to _normalize_ our tables with these previously ignored fields taken into consideration.

Let's start by setting some practical naming conventions. Note that these are not critical by any stretch, but can help remove some guess work when navigating a database with many tables and ids.

. Every table's primary key should be named `id`, unless it is a composite key. For example, instead of `book_id` in the `books` table, it would make sense to call that column `id` -- "book" is implied from the table name.
. Every table's foreign key should reference the `id` column of the foreign table and be named "foreign_table_name_id". For example, if we had a foreign key in the `books` table that referenced an author in the `authors` table, we should name that column `author_id`.
. Keep table names plural, when possible -- for example, not the `book` table, but the `books` table.
. Link tables or junction tables should be named by the two tables which you are trying to represent the many-to-many relationship for. (We will go over this one specifically when needed, no worries)

Make the appropriate changes to the following `CREATE TABLE` statements that reflect these conventions as much as possible (for now).

sqlite3 $HOME/my.db "CREATE TABLE reviews (
	user_id TEXT,

=== Question 3

A book can have many authors, and an author can have many books. This is an example of a many-to-many relationship. 

We already have a `books` table and an `authors` table. Create a _junction_ or _link_ table that effectively _normalizes_ the `authors` **field** in the `books` table. Call this new table `books_authors` (see point 4 above -- this is the naming convention we want).

Make sure to include your `CREATE TABLE` statement in your notebook.

[TIP]
====
There should be 4 columns in the `authors_books` table. A primary key field, two foreign key fields, and a regular data field that is a part of the original `authors` field data in the `books` table.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to properly apply the https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-primary-key/[primary key] and https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-foreign-key/[foreign key] keywords.
====

Write a SQL query to find every book by author with id 12345. It doesn't have to be perfect syntax, as long as the logic is correct. In addition, it won't be runnable, that is okay.

[TIP]
====
You will need to use _joins_ and our junction table to perform this query.
====

Copy, paste, and update your `bash` cell with the `CREATE TABLE` statements to implement these changes. In a markdown cell, write out your SQL query.

=== Question 4

Assume that a series can have many books and a book can be a part of many series. Perform the same operations as the previous problem (except for the query).

What columns does the `books_series` table have?

=== Question 5

The remaining two fields that need to be dealt with are `similar_books` and `popular_shelves`. Choose _at least_ one of the two and do your best to come up with a good solution for the way we store the data. We will give hints for both below.

For this question, please copy, paste, and update the `bash` cell with the `CREATE TABLE` statements. In addition, please include a markdown cell with a detailed explanation of _why_ you chose your solution, and provide at least 1 example of a query that _should_ work for your solution (like before, we are looking for logic, not syntax).

**similar_books:**

[TIP]
====
It is okay to have a link table that links rows from the same table!
====

[TIP]
====
There are always many ways to do the same thing. In our examples, we used link tables with their own `id` (primary key) in addition to multiple foreign keys. This provides the flexibility of later being able to add more fields to the link table, where it may even become useful all by itself.

There is, however, a _technically_ better solution for a table that is simply a link table and nothing more. This would be where you have 2 columns, both foreign keys, and you create a _composite_ primary key, or a primary key that is represented by the unique combination of both foreign keys. This ensures that links are only ever represented once. Feel free to experiment with this if you want!
====

**popular_shelves:**

[TIP]
====
You can create as many tables as you need.
====

[TIP]
====
After a bit of thinking, this one may not be too different than what you've already accomplished.
