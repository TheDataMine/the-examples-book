Many data science tools including xref:programming-languges:R:introduction[R] have powerful ways to index data.

.Insider Knowledge 
[%collapsible]
====
R typically has operations that are vectorized and there is little to no need to write loops. + 
R typically also uses indexing instead of using an if statement.

* Sequential statements (one after another) i.e. + 
1. print line 45 + 
2. print line 15 +

**if/else statements**
 create an order of direction based on a logical condition. +

if statement example:
[source,r]
----
x <- 7
if (x > 0){
print ("Positive number")
}
----
else statement example:
[source,r]
----
x <- -10
if(x >= 0){
print("Non-negative number")
} else {
print("Negative number")
}
----
In `R`, we can classify many numbers all at once:
[source,r]
----
x <- c(-10,3,1,-6,19,-3,12,-1)
mysigns <- rep("Non-negative number", times=8)
mysigns[x < 0] <- "Negative number"
mysigns
----

====
**Context:** As we continue to become more familiar with `R` this project will help reinforce the many ways of indexing data in `R`. 

**Scope:** r, data.frames, indexing. 

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].


Using the *f2022-s2023-r* kernel 
Lets first see all of the files that are in the `craigslist` folder 
[source,r]
----
list.files("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist")
----

After looking at several of the files we will go ahead and read in the data frame on the Vehicles
[source,r]
----
myDF <- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
----

.Helpful Hints
[%collapsible]
====
Remember: +

* If we want to see the file size (aka how large) of the CSV. 
[source,r]
----
file.info("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv")$size
----

* You can also use 'file.info' to see other information about the file.

It is so important that, each time we look at data, we start by becoming familiar with the data. +
In past projects we have looked at the head/tail along with the structure and the dimensions of the data. We want to continue this practice.

This dataset has 25 columns, and we are unable to see it all without adjusting the width.  We can do this by
[source,r]
----
options(repr.matrix.max.cols=25, repr.matrix.max.rows=200)
----
and we also remember (from the previous project) that we can set the output in `R` to look more natural this way:
[source,r]
----
options(jupyter.rich_display = F)
----


.Helpful Hint
[%collapsible]
====
You can look at the first 6 rows (`head`), the last 6 rows (`tail`), the structure (`str`), and/or the dimensions (`dim`) of the dataset. 
====

[loweralpha]
.. How many unique regions are there in total? Name 5 of the different regions that are included in this dataset.
.. How many cars are manufactured in 2011 or afterwards, i.e., they are made in 2011 or newer?
.. In what year was the oldest model manufactured? In what year was the most recent model manufactured? In which year were the most cars manufactured?

.Helpful Hint
[%collapsible]
====
To sort and order a single vector you can use this code:
[source,r]
----
head(myDF$year[order(myDF$year)])
----
You can also use the `sort` function, as demonstrated in earlier projects.

.. Create a new column in your data.frame that is labeled `newflag` which indicates if the vehicle for sale has been labeled as `like new`.  In other words, the column `newflag` should be `TRUE` if the vehicle on that row is `like new`, and `FALSE` otherwise.
.. Create a new column called `pricecategory` that is
... `cheap` for vehicles less than or equal to $1,500
... `average` for vehicles strictly more than $1,500 but less than or equal to $10,000
... `expensive` for vehicles strictly more than $10,000
.. How many cars are there in each of these three `pricecategories` ?

_**vectoriztion**_

Most of R's functions are vectorized, which means that the function will be applied to all elements of a vector, without needing to loop through the elements one at a time. The most common way to access individual elements is by using the `[]` symbol for indexing. 

[loweralpha]
.. Using the `table()` function, and the column `myDF$newflag`, identify how many vehicles are `like new` and how many vehicles are not `like new`. 
.. Now using the `cut` function and appropriate `breaks`, create a new column called `newpricecategory`.  Verify that this column is identical to the previously created `pricecategory` column, created in question TWO.
.. Make another column called `odometerage`, which has values `new` or `middle age` or `old`, according to whether the odometer is (respectively): less than or equal to 50000; strictly greater than 50000 and less than or equal to 100000; or strictly greater than 100000.  How many cars are in each of these categories?

.. Extract all of the data for `indianapolis` into a `data.frame` called `myIndy`
.. Identify the most popular region from `myDF`, and extract all of the data from that region into a `data.frame` called `popularRegion`.
.. Create a third `data.frame` with the data from a region of your choice
