= TDM 10200: Project 4 -- 2024

**Motivation:** In the last project, we began exploring control flow, including if statements and for loops. In this project, we will delve deeper into the concept of loops. There are three main types of loops that we will focus on: for loops, while loops, and nested loops.

**Context:**  We will continue to work on some basic data types and will discuss some similar control flow concepts.

**Scope:** loops, basic data structures such as tuples, lists, loops, dict

== Dataset

All questions in this project will use the data sets in this directory:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/`

Just as we did in Project 3, please remember to use `header=None` when you read in the data set, and remember to use:

`names=["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"]`

to create the column names.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Use Pandas iterrows to loop over the `1880.csv` data set.  For any row that has information about precipitation (in the element code), if the value column in that row is more than 1200, print the date for that row.  (Hint:  Ten rows meet this condition, so you should print a total of 10 dates.)
.. Same question, also using the `1880.csv` data set, but now we would like you to use indexing to answer the same question from question 1a.
.. Which of these two approaches is faster?  Which one do you understand more?
 
=== Question 2 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Write a for loop that displays the average precipitation per year, for each year from 1800 to 1850.  On each line of your output, print the year and the average precipitation for that year.
.. Change your for loop to a while loop, which prints the average precipitation, for each year from 1800 to 1850 BUT stops printing after the first year with average precipitation 22 or higher.  (Hint:  You will see that, because of the behavior of your while loop, it should print the average precipitation for the years 1800 to 1813.)

=== Question 3 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. For the `1880.csv` data, find the average precipitation for each `id`.  Which `id` has the largest average precipitation?  (Hint: The average precipitation for this `id` is 610; which `id` has that largest average precipitation?)
.. What is the average precipitation for the `id` `USC00288878`?
 
=== Question 4 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Change the results from question 3a into a dictionary.  (Hint: Depending on how you solved question 3a, if you did it like Dr Ward did it, you probably got a series in question 3a, and you can probably use the `to_dict()` method to convert the series into a dictionary.)

=== Question 5 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. You have used while loops and for loops on this project.  Please choose any two data sets that we have posted on Anvil (they do not have to be NOAA data sets from `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/`.  It is totally OK to use any data set in `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/`) and use a while loop or a for loop and explore the data.  Show us something cool that you learned about these two data sets that you picked.  Anything is OK; you have some freedom to explore!
