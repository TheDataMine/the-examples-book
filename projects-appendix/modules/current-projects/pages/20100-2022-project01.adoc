= TDM 20100: Project 1 -- 2022

**Motivation:** It’s been a long summer! Last year, you got some exposure to both R and Python. This semester, we will venture away from R and Python, and focus on UNIX utilities like `sort`, `awk`, `grep`, and `sed`. While Python and R are extremely powerful tools that can solve many problems — they aren’t always the best tool for the job. UNIX utilities can be an incredibly efficient way to solve problems that would be much less efficient using R or Python. In addition, there will be a variety of projects where we explore SQL using `sqlite3` and `MySQL/MariaDB`.

We will start slowly, however, by learning about Jupyter Lab. This year, instead of using RStudio Server, we will be using Jupyter Lab. In this project we will become familiar with the new environment, review some, and prepare for the rest of the semester.

**Context:** This is the first project of the semester! We will start with some review, and set the "scene" to learn about some powerful UNIX utilities, and SQL the rest of the semester.

**Scope:** Jupyter Lab, R, Python, Anvil, markdown
