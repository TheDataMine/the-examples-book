= TDM 20100: Project 13 -- 2022

**Motivation:** We've covered a lot about SQL in a relatively short amount of time, but we still haven't touched on some other important SQL topics. In this final project, we will touch on some other important SQL topics.

**Context:** In the previous project, you had the opportunity to take the time to insert data into a `sqlite3` database. There are still many common tasks that you may need to perform using a database: triggers, views, transaction, and even a few `sqlite3`-specific functionalities that may prove useful.

**Scope:** SQL

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a trigger on your `sqlite3` database and demonstrate that it works.
- Create one or more views on your `sqlite3` database and demonstrate that they work.
- Describe and use a database transaction. Rollback a transaction.
- Optionally, use the `sqlite3` "savepoint", "rollback to", and "release" commands.
- Optionally, use the `sqlite3` "attach" and "detach" commands to execute queries across multiple databases.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/flights_sample.db`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

== Questions

=== Question 1

Begin by copying the database from the previous project to your `$HOME` directory. Open up a terminal and run the following.

[source,bash]
----
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/flights_sample.db $HOME
----

Go ahead and launch `sqlite3` and connect to the database.

[source,bash]
----
sqlite3 $HOME/flights_sample.db
----

From within `sqlite3`, test things out to make sure the data looks right.

[source, sql]
----
.header on
SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 5;
----

With any luck, things should be working just fine.

Let's go ahead and create a trigger. A trigger is what it sounds like, given a specific action, _do_ a specific action. This is a powerful tool. One of the most common uses of a trigger that you will see in the wild is the "updated_at" field. This is a field that stores a datetime value, and uses a _trigger_ to automatically update to the current date and time anytime a record in the database is updated.

First, we need to create a new column called "updated_at", and set the default value to something. In our case, lets set it to January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00. 

[source, sql]
----
ALTER TABLE flights ADD COLUMN updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT '1970-01-01 00:00:00';
----

If you query the table now, you will see all of the values have been properly added, great!

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 5;
----

Now add a trigger called "update_updated_at" that will update the "updated_at" column to the current date and time whenever a record is updated. Check out the official documentation https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html[here] for examples of triggers.

Once your trigger has been written, go ahead and test it out by updating the following record.

[source, sql]
----
UPDATE flights SET Year = 5555 WHERE Year = 2007 AND Month = 1 AND DayofMonth = 1 AND DayOfWeek = 1 AND DepTime = 1225 AND Origin = 'SMF';
----

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE Year = 5555;
----

If it worked right, your `updated_at` column should have been updated to the current date and time, cool!

Next, we will touch on _views_. A view is essentially a virtual table that is created from some query and given a name. Why would you want to create such a thing? Well, there could be many reasons.

Maybe you have a complex query that you need to run frequently, and it would just be easier to see the final result with a click? Maybe the database has horrible naming conventions and you want to rename things in a view to make it more readable and/or queryable?

After some thought, it may occur to you that we've had such an instance where a view could be nice using our `imdb.db` database!

Copy the `imdb.db` to your `$SCRATCH` directory, and navigate to your `$SCRATCH` directory.

[source,bash]
----
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db $SCRATCH
cd $SCRATCH
----

Sometimes, it would be nice to have the `rating` and `votes` from the `ratings` table available directly from the titles table, wouldn't it? It has been a bit of a hassle to access that information and use a JOIN whenever we've had a need to see rating information. In fact, if you think about it, the rating information living in its own table doesn't really make that much sense. 

Create a _view_ called `titles_with_ratings` that has all of the information from the `titles` table along with the `rating` and `votes` from the `ratings` table. You can find the official documentation https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createview.html[here].

Read the offical `sqlite3` documentation for transactions https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html[here]. As you will read, you've already been using transactions each time you run a query! What we will focus on is how to use transactions to _rollback_ changes, as this is probably the most useful use case you'll run into.

Connect to our `flights_sample.db` database from question (1), start a _deferred_ transaction, and update a row, similar to what we did before, using the following query.

[source, sql]
----
UPDATE flights SET Year = 7777 WHERE Year = 5555;
----

Now, query the record to see what it looks like.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE Year = 7777;
----

[NOTE]
====
You'll notice our _trigger_ from before is still working, cool!
====

This is pretty great, until you realized that the year should most definitely _not_ be 7777, but rather be 5555. Oh no! Well, at this stage you haven't committed your transaction yet, so you can just _rollback_ the changes and everything will be back to normal. Give it a try (again, following the official documentation).

After rolling back, run the following query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE Year = 7777;
----

As you can see, nothing appears! Let's try with the correct year.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE Year = 5555;
----

Nice! Note only was our `Year` field rolled back to the original values after question (1), but our `updated_at` field was too, excellent! As you can imagine, this is pretty powerful stuff, especially if you are writing to a database and want to make sure things look right before _committing_ the changes.

SQL and `sqlite3` are powerful tools, and we've barely scratched the surface. Check out the https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html[offical documentation], and demonstrate another feature of `sqlite3` that we haven't yet covered.

Some suggestions, if you aren't interested in browsing the documentation: https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html#biwinfunc[window functions], https://www.sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html[math functions], https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html[date and time functions], and https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html[core functions] (there are many we didn't use!)

Please make sure the queries you run are run from an sql cell in your Jupyter notebook.

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.

=== Question 5 (optional, 0 pts)

There are two other interesting features of `sqlite3`: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html[savepoints] (kind of a named transaction) and https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html[attach and detach]. Demonstrate one or both of these functionalities and write 1-2 sentences stating whether or not you think they are practical or useful features, and why or why not?
