= TDM 20200: Project 5 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Dash is a web application framework. It can create web based visualization, provide a simple way to create interactive user interfaces. Dash uses Plotly for its plotting capabilities. It can build interactive dashboards for data visualization. Ultimately, a dashboard is really a website focused on displaying data. 


**Context:** Create good visualizations about housing data using "plotly", "Dash"

**Scope:** Python, visualizations, plotly, Dash, DashBoards, Visual Studio Code

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a development environment to building a dashboard on Anvil 
- Develop skills and techniques to create a dashboard using 'plotly','dash', 'Visual Studio Code'
****

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
[loweralpha]

Navigate to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu and click on "Visual Studio Code" under "The Date Mine". Choose the following:

- Allocation: "cis220051"
- CPU Cores: 1
- Starting Directory: "Home Directory"

Then, click on the "Launch" button. Wait for the "Connect to VS Code" button appear, then click it.

If you get "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder" window pop up, click "Yes, I trust the authors"

.. Now following https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guid] to Initial Configuration of VS Code
.. Check your python3 path with following statement and make sure your output is the output show below.

[source,python]
----
which python3
----
.output
/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a test python file in Visual Studio Code, named it "test.py" to print your name, your major and your comments if you have any
.. Run the file through terminal

=== Question 3 (2 points)

..  hostname
.. find out the port number this vscode session running at
.. Assemble the prefix string with f- strings

=== Question 4 (2 points)

Finally, let's install the "Remote Explorer" **and** "Remote SSH" extension in VS Code. These extensions will allow us to connect to Anvil from VS Code and develop on Anvil from our local machine. You can find instructions for browsing and installing extensions https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace[here]. 

Once installed, you should see an icon on the left-hand side of VS Code that looks like a computer screen. Click on it.

In the new menu on the left, click the little settings cog. Select the first option, which should be either `/Users/username/.ssh/config` (if on a mac) or `C:\Users\username\.ssh\config` (if on windows). This will open a file in VS Code. Add the following to the file:

.mac config
----
Host anvil
    HostName anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
----

.windows config
----
Host anvil
    HostName anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
    User username
    IdentityFile C:\Users\username\.ssh\id_ed25519
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
On Windows, make sure to replace "username" with your _Anvil_ username, for example "x-kamstut". Do this both for the "User" section and the "IdentityFile" section in the ssh config file.
====

Save the file and close out of it. Now, if all is well, you will see an "anvil" option under the "SSH TARGETS" menu. Right click on "anvil" and click "Connect to Host in Current Window". Wow! You will now be connected to Anvil! Try opening a file -- notice how the files are the files you have on Anvil -- that is super cool!

Open a terminal in VS Code by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows) and typing "terminal". You should see a "Terminal: Create new terminal" option appear. Select it and you should notice a terminal opening at the bottom of your vscode window. That terminal is on Anvil too! Way cool! Run the api by running the following in the new terminal:

[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
module load python/f2022-s2023
cd $HOME/hithere
python3 -m uvicorn imdb.api:app --reload --port 50087
----

If you are prompted something about port forwarding allow it. In addition open up a browser on your own computer and test out the following links: `localhost:50087` and `localhost:50087/hithere/bob`. Wow! VS Code even takes care of forwarding ports so you can access the API from the comfort of your own computer and browser! This will be extremely useful for the rest of the semester!

For this question, submit a couple of screenshots demonstrating opening code on Anvil from VS Code on your local computer, and accessing the API from your local browser.

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.

=== Question 5

There are tons of cool extensions and themes in VS Code. Go ahead and apply a new theme you like and download some extensions. 

For this question, submit a screenshot of your tricked out VS Code setup with some Python code open. Have some fun!
