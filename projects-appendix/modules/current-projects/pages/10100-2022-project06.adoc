.. What is the average age of Females versus Males at death?
.. What is the number of Females who are married? Divorced? Widowed? Single?  Now find the analogous numbers for Males.
.. Now solve both questions from 4b at one time, i.e., use one command to find the number of Females who are married, divorced, widowed, or single, and the number of Males in each of these four categories.  You can compute all eight numbers with just one `tapply` command.
