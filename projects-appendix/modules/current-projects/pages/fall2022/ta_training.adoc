= Seminar TA Training

== Welcome to The Data Mine Seminar Course!

Course content lives within The Projects appendix of The Example Book (the pages you are reading right now). We have migrated away from hosting our content in Brightspace to make our content publicly accessible as we expand. 

Teaching Assistants (TAs) will use Gradescope to submit their training. Students will also continue to use link:https://www.gradescope.com/[Gradescope] as the submission portal for projects and outside events.  

== TA Responsibility Overview

TAs are a key part of success in The Data Mine. Your constant support in seminars, grading, and office hours keeps the courses running smoothly. 

Navigate to the xref:fall2022/ta_schedule.adoc[Seminar TA Fall 2022 Schedule] to find due dates for training, grading, and time sheets.

=== Office Hours 
TAs will choose their office hour times and will be expected to hold their scheduled office hours consistently.
Please see the list of required office hours to know how many hours you're required to hold. This was sent out to the TAs.

For the first 3 weeks of the semester, we need a few T.A.s (at least one for 19000 and one for 29000) in each of the seminar times and in the hour after each seminar. We definitely need lots of help on Thursday and Friday. Evenings are much appreciated because we have students all over the world who will need help. Friday evenings are prime time, and we may permit more than one TA working at a time then.

Please keep track of how many students come to each of your office hours during the first 3 weeks of the semester. We will reshuffle a bit based on popular times after the first 3 weeks.

==== Set up your Office Hours.
Use your personal Webex room to hold your office hours. Go to https://purdue.webex.com/ and log in with your Purdue credentials. You do not need to schedule a meeting for your office hours, just list your personal Webex room. For example, First_name Last_name personal Webex room is: https://purdue.webex.com/join/Last_name/.

==== Choose your time
When choosing your office hour time slot(s), please consider your own schedule and conflicts such as classes. 

Use link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tw9qbXD9_2dtOB6AYYUxfHfp-Aow5NB-8tVZk3e4MLI/edit?usp=sharing[this link] to select your office hour time and add your Webex link to the spreadsheet.
