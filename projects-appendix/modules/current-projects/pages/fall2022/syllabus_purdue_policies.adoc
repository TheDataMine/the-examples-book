== Purdue Policies & Resources 

=== Academic Guidance in the Event a Student is Quarantined/Isolated 
While everything we are doing in The Data Mine this semester can be done online, rather than in person, and no part of your seminar grade comes from attendance, we want to remind you of general campus attendance policies during COVID-19. Students should stay home and contact the Protect Purdue Health Center (496-INFO) if they feel ill, have any symptoms associated with COVID-19, or suspect they have been exposed to the virus. In the current context of COVID-19, in-person attendance will not be a factor in the final grades, but the student still needs to inform the instructor of any conflict that can be anticipated and will affect the submission of an assignment. Only the instructor can excuse a student from a course requirement or responsibility. When conflicts can be anticipated, such as for many University-sponsored activities and religious observations, the student should inform the instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible. For unanticipated or emergency conflict, when advance notification to an instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible by email or by phone. When the student is unable to make direct contact with the instructor and is unable to leave word with the instructor's department because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and in cases of bereavement, quarantine, or isolation, the student or the student's representative should contact the Office of the Dean of Students via email or phone at 765-494-1747. Below are links on Attendance and Grief Absence policies under the University Policies menu.

If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation. Please note the link:https://protect.purdue.edu/updates/video-update-protect-purdue-fall-expectations/[Protect Purdue fall 2022 expectations] announced on the Protect Purdue website.

=== Class Behavior

You are expected to behave in a way that promotes a welcoming, inclusive, productive learning environment.  You need to be prepared for your individual and group work each week, and you need to include everybody in your group in any discussions.  Respond promptly to all communications and show up for any appointments that are scheduled.  If your group is having trouble working well together, try hard to talk through the difficulties--this is an important skill to have for future professional experiences.  If you are still having difficulties, ask The Data Mine staff to meet with your group.


*Purdue's Copyrighted Materials Policy:*

Among the materials that may be protected by copyright law are the lectures, notes, and other material presented in class or as part of the course. Always assume the materials presented by an instructor are protected by copyright unless the instructor has stated otherwise. Students enrolled in, and authorized visitors to, Purdue University courses are permitted to take notes, which they may use for individual/group study or for other non-commercial purposes reasonably arising from enrollment in the course or the University generally.
Notes taken in class are, however, generally considered to be "derivative works" of the instructor's presentations and materials, and they are thus subject to the instructor's copyright in such presentations and materials. No individual is permitted to sell or otherwise barter notes, either to other students or to any commercial concern, for a course without the express written permission of the course instructor. To obtain permission to sell or barter notes, the individual wishing to sell or barter the notes must be registered in the course or must be an approved visitor to the class. Course instructors may choose to grant or not grant such permission at their own discretion, and may require a review of the notes prior to their being sold or bartered. If they do grant such permission, they may revoke it at any time, if they so choose.

=== Nondiscrimination Statement
Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community which recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her own potential.  In pursuit of its goal of academic excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture diversity.  The University believes that diversity among its many members strengthens the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes the exchange of ideas, and enriches campus life. link:https://www.purdue.edu/purdue/ea_eou_statement.php[Link to Purdue's nondiscrimination policy statement.]

=== Students with Disabilities

If you have been certified by the Office of the Dean of Students as someone needing a course adaptation or accommodation because of a disability OR if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please contact The Data Mine staff during the first week of classes.

=== Violent Behavior Policy

Purdue strives to create an educational environment for students and a work environment for employees that promote educational and career goals. Violent Behavior impedes such goals. Therefore, Violent Behavior is prohibited in or on any University Facility or while participating in any university activity. See the link:https://www.purdue.edu/policies/facilities-safety/iva3.html[University's full violent behavior policy] for more detail.

=== Diversity and Inclusion Statement

In our discussions, structured and unstructured, we will explore a variety of challenging issues, which can help us enhance our understanding of different experiences and perspectives. This can be challenging, but in overcoming these challenges we find the greatest rewards. While we will design guidelines as a group, everyone should remember the following points:

* We are all in the process of learning about others and their experiences. Please speak with me, anonymously if needed, if something has made you uncomfortable.
* Intention and impact are not always aligned, and we should respect the impact something may have on someone even if it was not the speaker's intention.
* We all come to the class with a variety of experiences and a range of expertise, we should respect these in others while critically examining them in ourselves.

=== Basic Needs Security Resources 

Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. There is no appointment needed and Student Support Services is available to serve students from 8:00 - 5:00, Monday through Friday. The link:https://www.purdue.edu/vpsl/leadership/About/ACE_Campus_Pantry.html[ACE Campus Food Pantry] is open to the entire Purdue community). 

Considering the significant disruptions caused by the current global crisis as it related to COVID-19, students may submit requests for emergency assistance from the link:https://www.purdue.edu/odos/resources/critical-need-fund.html[Critical Needs Fund]. 

=== Course Evaluation

During the last two weeks of the semester, you will be provided with an opportunity to give anonymous feedback on this course and your instructor. Purdue uses an online course evaluation system. You will receive an official email from evaluation administrators with a link to the online evaluation site. You will have up to 10 days to complete this evaluation. Your participation is an integral part of this course, and your feedback is vital to improving education at Purdue University. I strongly urge you to participate in the evaluation system. 

You may email feedback to us anytime at link:mailto:datamine-help@purdue.edu[datamine-help@purdue.edu]. We take feedback from our students seriously, as we want to create the best learning experience for you!  

=== General Classroom Guidance Regarding Protect Purdue 

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person is threatening the safety of others by not complying with Protect Purdue protocols is encouraged to report the behavior to and discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option of reporting the behavior to the link:https://purdue.edu/odos/osrr/[Office of the Student Rights and Responsibilities]. See also link:https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights[Purdue University Bill of Student Rights] and the Violent Behavior Policy under University Resources in Brightspace.
