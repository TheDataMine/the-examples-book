= TDM 20100: Project 4 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Becoming comfortable chaining commands and getting used to navigating files in a terminal is important for every data scientist to do. By learning the basics of a few useful tools, you will have the ability to quickly understand and manipulate files in a way which is just not possible using tools like Microsoft Office, Google Sheets, etc. While it is always fair to whip together a script using your favorite language, you may find that these UNIX tools are a better fit for your needs.

**Context:** We've been using UNIX tools in a terminal to solve a variety of problems. In this project we will continue to solve problems by combining a variety of tools using a form of redirection called 'piping'. 

**Scope:** grep, regular expression basics, UNIX utilities, redirection, piping

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use `cut` to section off and slice up data from the command line.
- Use `|` piping to string UNIX commands together.
- Use `sort` and it's options to sort data in different ways.
- Use `head` to isolate n lines of output.
- Use `wc` to summarize the number of lines in a file or in output.
- Use `uniq` to filter out non-unique lines.
- Use `grep` to search files effectively.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/*`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/processed/*`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt`

== Questions

[WARNING]
====
For this project, please submit a `.sh` text file with all of you `bash` code written inside of it. This should be submitted _in addition to_ your notebook (the `.ipynb` file). Failing to submit the accompanying `.sh` file may result and points being removed from your final submission. Thanks!
====
[NOTE]
====
Let's look at the following statement
[source,bash]
head -n 1 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/2011.csv | tr ',' '\n' | wc -l

The output of this statement will be how many columns in the first line of the csv file "2011.csv"

In a csv file, there are numOfComma+1 columns where numOfComma is the number of commas (in theory). The statement takes the first line of `unprocessed/2011.csv` with `head` command, replaces all commas with the newline character `\n` with command `tr`, then use command `wc` to count the resulting number of lines.

=== Question 1 (1 pt)

[upperalpha]

.. Let's look at the same file of 2011.csv, Please use commands `head`, 'tr` and `wc` to find out how many times does the character 'A' appear in the first 10 lines of the file? 

 
[NOTE]
====
As you can see, csv files are not always so straightforward to parse. For this particular set of questions, we want to focus on using some other UNIX tools that are more useful on semi-clean datasets, e.g., awk 

Let's look at the first few lines of the data in 'processed/2011.csv'
[source, bash]
head -n 1 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/processed/2011.csv | awk -F";" '{print NF}'  

The output of this statement will be the column number of the first line of the file 2011.csv

The statement use `awk` to

    -F";": Set the field separator to ;.
    {print NF}: Print the number of fields in each line.

====
=== Question 2 (1 pt)

//[arabic]
[upperalpha]

.. Use UNIX tool 'awk' to find out how many columns in the fifth row of the file - 'iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt'


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

[arabic] 
.. In file `iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt`, what are the 5 largest orders by number of bottles sold?
.. In file `iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt`, what are the 5 largest orders by number of Gallons sold? 

[TIP]
====
`cat`, `cut`, `sort`, and `head` will be useful.
====

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 4 (1 pt)

[arabic]

.. What are the different sizes (in ml) that a bottle of liquor comes in?

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

[arabic]

.. Use any available 'bash' tools, e.g., 'cat', 'cut', 'sort','uniq' etc. to count the starting digit of the field sale (dollars) in the file iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt 
..  Write 1-2 sentences explaining what you think if there could be some "funny business" going on

[NOTE]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law[Benford's law] states that the leading digit in real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to follow a distinct distribution (see the plot in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law[provided link]). By this logic, the dollar amount in the orders should roughly match this
