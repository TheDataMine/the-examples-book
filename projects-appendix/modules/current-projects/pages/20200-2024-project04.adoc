= TDM 20200: Project 4 -- 2024

**Motivation:** It is worthwhile to learn how to parse hundreds of thousands of files systematically. We practice this skill, step by step.

**Context:** We return to the over-the-counter medications from Project 1, aiming to extract the ingredient substances from each medication, and creating a tally of all of the ingredient substances.

**Scope:** Python, XML

.Learning Objectives
****
- Extract XML content from a large number of files and summarize some of the content in the files. 
****
 

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/archive1`

through

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/archive10`


[NOTE]
====
- It is worthwhile to review the skills learned in Project 1, in which we analyzed the files:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/valu.xml`

and

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/hawaii.xml`

- We already downloaded and uncompressed the 10 zip files from the website https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/spl-resources-all-drug-labels.cfm for the `Human OTC Labels` data.  We only stored the `.xml` files and removed the `.jpg` files (we do not need the `.jpg` files for this project).

- The uncompressed files are stored in the directories:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/archive1`

through

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/archive10`

[NOTE]
====
When building the dictionary, you will see that Dr Ward writes:

[source,python]
----
if mystring not in mydict:
    mydict[mystring] = 1
else:
    mydict[mystring] += 1
----
Some of you will not have worked with dictionaries too much in the past.  Dictionaries start out empty, and you need to add the words as you go.

Alternatively, if you want to, you can just write:
[source,python]
----
mydict[mystring] = mydict.get(mystring, 0) + 1
----
This approach is a little bit cleaner, but I didn't know if you would understand it.  If `mystring` is missing from the dictionary, then `mydict.get(mystring, 0)` will return 0, so that `mydict[mystring]` is created with a value of 1.  Otherwise, if `mystring` is already in the dictionary, then `mydict.get(mystring, 0)` will return the previous number of occurrences, so that `mydict[mystring]` gets bumped up by 1, to account for the new occurrence of `mystring`.

Either approach is OK, and you might have another Pythonic way that you want to handle this step in creating the dictionary.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

Run the lines:

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
import lxml.etree
import glob
----

[loweralpha]
.. Remind yourself how to extract the ingredient substances from each of these two files: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/valu.xml` and `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/hawaii.xml`

For each of these two files, print a list of all ingredient substances (it is OK if some are repeated; also, do not worry about which ingredient that the ingredient substances come from).  For instance, if you extract the ingredient substances from the file

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/valu.xml`

you should get these ingredient substances:

[source,bash]
----
HYPROMELLOSES
MINERAL OIL
POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL, UNSPECIFIED
POLYSORBATE 80
POVIDONE, UNSPECIFIED
... blah blah blah ...
STARCH, CORN
SODIUM STARCH GLYCOLATE TYPE A CORN
STEARIC ACID
TITANIUM DIOXIDE
ACETAMINOPHEN
----

or if you extract the ingredient substances from the file

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/hawaii.xml`

you should get these ingredient substances:

[source,bash]
----
DIBASIC CALCIUM PHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE
WATER
SORBITOL
SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE
CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE SODIUM, UNSPECIFIED FORM
... blah blah blah ...
WHITE WAX
MANGIFERA INDICA SEED BUTTER
ROSEMARY OIL
TOCOPHEROL
ZINC OXIDE
----

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Use this Python code: `for myfile in glob.glob("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/archive1/*.xml")[0:11]` and use also this code: `tree = lxml.etree.parse(myfile)` to loop over the first eleven files in the `archive1` directory.  Print all of the ingredient substances from these first eleven files.
.. Make a Python *dictionary* (called a `dict` in Python) from the ingredient substances, keeping track of the number of times that each ingredient substance occurs.
 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Convert the dictionary from question 2b to a data frame.
.. Sort the dataframe according to the counts, and print the 5 most popular ingredient substances from those 10 files, and the number of times that each of these 5 most popular ingredient substances occurs.  Your output should contain:

[source,bash]
----
COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE    60
FD&C BLUE NO. 1           70
CITRIC ACID MONOHYDRATE   87
GLYCERIN                  93
WATER                    114
----

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Now analyze the first 1000 files from the `archive1` directory, and print the output that shows the 5 most popular ingredient substances from those 1000 files, and the number of times that each of these 5 most popular ingredient substances occurs.
.. Now try to analyze all of the files from the `archive1` directory.  Likely, *your work will fail*, because there is at least one enormous file that needs a little bit fancier parsing method!  So you can add these lines:

[source,python]
----
from lxml.etree import XMLParser, parse
p = XMLParser(huge_tree=True)
----

and then add the parameter `parser=p` to your `parse` statement.  Now you can analyze all of the files from the `archive1` directory.  Print output that shows the 5 most popular ingredient substances from all of the files (altogether) in the `archive1` directory, and the number of times that each of these 5 most popular ingredient substances occurs.


=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Now analyze all of the files in all 10 directories `archive1` through `archive10`, and print output that shows the 5 most popular ingredient substances from all of the files (altogether) in these 10 directories, and the number of times that each of these 5 most popular ingredient substances occurs.
