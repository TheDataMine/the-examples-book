= TDM 20200: Project 11 -- 2024
 
**Motivation:** Machine learning and AI are huge buzzwords in industry, in this project, we will continue to learn more TensorFlow features.

**Context:** The purpose of these projects is to give you exposure to machine learning tools, some basic functionality, and a conceptual workflow to create and use a model *without needing any special math or statistics background*.

**Scope:** Python,tensorflow, scikit-learn,numpy

[WARNING]
====
You need to use 2 cores for your Jupyter Lab session for Project 11 this week.

[TIP]
====
You can use `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` if you want to see all of the columns in a very wide data frame.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

In the previous project you created a tensorflow model with limited data. Since it would need large data in order to create a meaningful tensorflow model, your model may not work well!  Nonetheless, we can still learn how we can create (and use!) the model, and how to check the performance power of the model.

.. First update your program from Project 10, building the `model` with more data.  Please use `nrows = 100000` from the data set `2014.csv`.  The test/training split should again be defined using:

`X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`

and using `epochs=10` when training the model.

[NOTE]
====
-  In question 1, we will use 2014 data to train the model, and in question 2, we will use 2019 data to test the model.  Please name your variables in a way that will enable you and the graders to both understand which variables are which.
====


=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Read in 100000 lines of data from the `2019.csv` file.
.. Save the predicted arrival delays as `predicted_arrival_delays_100k_2019` (or something similar)
.. Save the actual arrival delays as `actual_arrival_delays_100k_2019` (or something similar)

 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

Solve questions 1 and 2 again, this time using 500000 rows from the 2014 data and 500000 rows from the 2019 data.  Be sure to change all of your variable names accordingly.

=== Question 4 (2 points)

Use the data from question 2 (with 100000 rows of data), to study the predicted arrival delays for 2019 versus the actual arrival delays for 2019.  Please comment on what you find.

Be sure to (please) provide some explanation about what you learn, and (likely) some visualizations to justify your work.


=== Question 5 (2 points)

Now use the data from question 3 (with 500000 rows of data), to study the predicted arrival delays for 2019 versus the actual arrival delays for 2019.  Please comment on what you find.  Be sure to compare the effectiveness of using 100000 rows of data versus using 500000 rows of data.
