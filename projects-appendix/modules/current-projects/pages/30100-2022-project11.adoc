= TDM 30100: Project 11 -- 2022

**Motivation:** One of the primary ways to get and interact with data today is via APIs. APIs provide a way to access data and functionality from other applications. There are 3 very popular types of APIs that you will likely encounter in your work: RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, and gRPC APIs. Our focus for the remainder of the semester will be on RESTful APIs.

**Context:** We are working on a series of projects that focus on building and using RESTful APIs. We will learn some basics about interacting and using APIs, and even build our own API.

**Scope:** Python, APIs, requests, fastapi

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand and use the HTTP methods with the `requests` library.
- Write REST APIs using the `fastapi` library to deliver data and functionality to a client.
- Identify the various components of a URL. 
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Questions

=== Question 1

[WARNING]
====
If at any time you get stuck, please make a Piazza post and we will help you out!
====

For this project, we will be doing something a little different in order to _try_ to make the API development experience on Anvil more pleasant. In addition, I imagine many of you will enjoy what we are going to setup and use it for other projects (or maybe even corporate partners projects).

Typically, when developing an API, you will have a set of code that you will update and modify. To see the results, you will run your API on a certain _port_ (for example 7777), and then interact with the API using a _client_. The most typical client is probably a web browser. So if we had an API running on port 7777, we could interact with it by navigating to `http://localhost:7777` in our browser.

This is not so simple to do on Anvil, or at least not very enjoyable. While there are a variety of ways, the easiest is to use the "Desktop" app on https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu and use the provided editor and browser on the slow and clunky web interface. This is not ideal, and is what we want to avoid. 

Don't just take our word for it, try it out. Navigate to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu and click on "Desktop" under "Interactive Apps". Choose the following:

- Allocation: "cis220051"
- Queue: "shared"
- Wall Time in Hours: 1
- Cores: 1

Then, click on the "Launch" button. Wait a minute and click on the "Launch Desktop" button when it appears.

Now, lets copy over our example API and run it.

. Click on Applications > Terminal Emulator
. Run the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
module load python/f2022-s2023
cp -a /anvil/projects/tdm/etc/hithere $HOME
cd $HOME/hithere
----
+
. Then, find an unused port by running the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
find_port # 50087
----
+
. In our example the output was 50087. Now run the API using that port (the port _you_ found).
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m uvicorn imdb.api:app --reload --port 50087
----

Finally, the last step is to open a browser and check out the API. 

. Click on Applications > Web Browser
. First navigate to `localhost:50087`
. Next navigate to `localhost:50087/hithere/yourname`

From here, your development process would be to modify the Python files, let the API reload with the changes, and interact with the API using the browser. This is all pretty clunky due to the slowness of the desktop-in-browser experience. In the remainder of this project we will setup something more pleasant.

For this question, submit a screenshot of your work environment on https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu using the "Desktop" app. It would be best to include both the browser and terminal in the screenshot.

=== Question 2

The first step in this process is an easy one. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code] on your local machine. This is a free, open source, and cross-platform editor. It is very popular and has a lot of great features that make it easy and enjoyable to use.

For this question, submit a screenshot of your local machine with a VS Code window open.

=== Question 3

You may be wondering how we are going to use VS Code on your _local_ machine to develop on Anvil. The answer is we are going to use a tool called `ssh` along with a VSCode extension to make this process seamless.

Read through https://the-examples-book.com/data-science/unix/ssh[this] page in order to gain a cursory knowledge of `ssh` and how to create public/private key pairs. Generate a public/private key pair on your local machine and add your public key to Anvil. For convenience, we've highlighted the steps below for both Mac and Windows.

**Mac**

. Open a terminal window on your local machine.
. Run the following command to generate a public/private key pair:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
----
+ 
. Click enter twice to _not_ enter a passphrase (for convenience, if you want to follow the other instructions, feel free). 
. Display the public key contents:
+
[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
----
+
. Highlight the contents of the public key and copy it to your clipboard.
. Navigate to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu and click on "Clusters" > "Anvil Shell Access". 
. Once presented with a terminal, run the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/.ssh
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# press "i" (for insert) then paste the contents of your public key on a newline
# then press Ctrl+c, and type ":wq" to save and quit

# set the permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
----
. Now, confirm that it works by opening a terminal on your local machine and typing the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh username@anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
----
+
. Be sure to replace "username" with your _Anvil_ username, for example "x-kamstut".
. Upon success, you should be immediately connected to Anvil _without_ typing a password -- cool!

**Windows**

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement[This] article may be useful.

. Open a command prompt. 
. Run the following command to generate a public/private key pair:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -a 100 -t ed25519
----
+
. Click enter twice to _not_ enter a passphrase (for convenience, if you want to follow the other instructions, feel free). 
. Display the public key contents:
+
[source,bash]
----
type %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub
----
+
. Highlight the contents of the public key and copy it to your clipboard.
. Navigate to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu and click on "Clusters" > "Anvil Shell Access". 
. Once presented with a terminal, run the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/.ssh
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# press "i" (for insert) then paste the contents of your public key on a newline
# then press Ctrl+c, and type ":wq" to save and quit

# set the permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
----
. Now, confirm that it works by opening a command prompt on your local machine and typing the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh username@anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
----
+
. Be sure to replace "username" with your _Anvil_ username, for example "x-kamstut".
. Upon success, you should be immediately connected to Anvil _without_ typing a password -- cool!

=== Question 4

Finally, let's install the "Remote Explorer" or "Remote SSH" extension in VS Code. This extension will allow us to connect to Anvil from VS Code and develop on Anvil from our local machine. Once installed, click on the icon on the left-hand side of VS Code that looks like a computer screen.

In the new menu on the left, click the little settings cog. Select the first option, which should be either `/Users/username/.ssh/config` (if on a mac) or `C:\Users\username\.ssh\config` (if on windows). This will open a file in VS Code. Add the following to the file:

.mac config
----
Host anvil
    HostName anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
----

.windows config
----
Host anvil
    HostName anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
    User username
    IdentityFile C:\Users\username\.ssh\id_ed25519
----

Save the file and close out of it. Now, if all is well, you will see an "anvil" option under the "SSH TARGETS" menu. Right click on "anvil" and click "Connect to Host in Current Window". Wow! You will now be connected to Anvil! Try opening a file -- notice how the files are the files you have on Anvil -- that is super cool!

Open a terminal in VS Code by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows) and typing "terminal". You should see a "Terminal: Create new terminal" option appear. Select it and you should notice a terminal opening at the bottom of your vscode window. That terminal is on Anvil too! Way cool! Run the api by running the following in the new terminal:

[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
module load python/f2022-s2023
cd $HOME/hithere
python3 -m uvicorn imdb.api:app --reload --port 50087
----

If you are prompted something about port forwarding allow it. In addition open up a browser on your own computer and test out the following links: `localhost:50087` and `localhost:50087/hithere/bob`. Wow! VS Code even takes care of forwarding ports so you can access the API from the comfort of your own computer and browser! This will be extremely useful for the rest of the semester!

For this question, submit a couple of screenshots demonstrating opening code on Anvil from VS Code on your local computer, and accessing the API from your local browser.
