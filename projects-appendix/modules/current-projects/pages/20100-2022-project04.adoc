= TDM 20100: Project 4 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Becoming comfortable chaining commands and getting used to navigating files in a terminal is important for every data scientist to do. By learning the basics of a few useful tools, you will have the ability to quickly understand and manipulate files in a way which is just not possible using tools like Microsoft Office, Google Sheets, etc. While it is always fair to whip together a script using your favorite language, you may find that these UNIX tools are a better fit for your needs.

**Context:** We've been using UNIX tools in a terminal to solve a variety of problems. In this project we will continue to solve problems by combining a variety of tools using a form of redirection called piping. 

**Scope:** grep, regular expression basics, UNIX utilities, redirection, piping

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use `cut` to section off and slice up data from the command line.
- Use piping to string UNIX commands together.
- Use `sort` and it's options to sort data in different ways.
- Use `head` to isolate n lines of output.
- Use `wc` to summarize the number of lines in a file or in output.
- Use `uniq` to filter out non-unique lines.
- Use `grep` to search files effectively.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/*`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/processed/*`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1

In a csv file, there are n+1 columns where n is the number of commas (in theory). Take the first line of `unprocessed/2011.csv`, replace all commas with the newline character, `\n`, and use `wc` to count the resulting number of lines. This should approximate how many columns are in the dataset. What is the value?

This can't be right, can it? Print the first 100 lines after using `tr` to replace commas with newlines. What do you notice?

[TIP]
====
The newline character in UNIX is `\n`.

=== Question 2

As you can see, csv files are not always so straightforward to parse. For this particular set of questions, we want to focus on using other UNIX tools that are more useful on semi-clean datasets. Take a look at the first few lines of the data in `processed/2011.csv`. How many columns are there?

Take a look at `iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.csv` -- how many columns does that file have?

=== Question 3

Continuing to look at the `iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.csv` dataset, what are the 5 largest orders by number of bottles sold? How about by Gallons sold? 

[TIP]
====
`cat`, `cut`, `sort`, and `head` will be useful.

=== Question 5

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law[Benford's law] states that the leading digit in real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to follow a distinct distribution (see the plot in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law[provided link]). By this logic, the dollar amount in the orders should roughly match this, right? 

Use any available `bash` tools you'd like to get a good idea of the count or percentage of the sales (in dollars) by starting digit. Are the results expected? Could there be some "funny business" going on? Write 1-2 sentences explaining what you think.
