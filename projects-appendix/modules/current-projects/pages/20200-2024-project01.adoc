= TDM 20200: Project 1 -- 2024 

**Motivation:** Extensible Markup Language or XML is a very important file format for storing structured data. Even though formats like JSON, and csv tend to be more prevalent, many, many legacy systems still use XML, and it remains an appropriate format for storing complex data. In fact, JSON and csv are quickly becoming less relevant as new formats and serialization methods like https://arrow.apache.org/faq/[parquet] and https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[protobufs] are becoming more common.

 
**Context:** In this project we will use the `lxml` package in Python. This is a first project focusing on web scraping
 
**Scope:** python, XML

.Learning objectives
****
- Review and summarize the differences between XML and HTML/CSV.
- Match XML terms to sections of XML demonstrating working knowledge.

Check out https://thedatamine.github.io/the-examples-book/projects.html#p01-290[this old project] that uses a different dataset -- you may find it useful for this project.

Please checkout https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/lxml[this] Example Book lxml introduction, the last section contains examples to parse XML file with namespaces

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/otc/valu.xml`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Please use the `lxml` package to find and print the name of the root element's tag for the XML file of valu.xml
 
=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Please use 'xpath' with namespace to find the 'title' element.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will need to use namespace for xpath; otherwise, you won't get the element.
https://lxml.de/xpathxslt.html[This link] will show you more information using about XPath with lxml
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Please use 'xpath' with namespace to find and list all child elements directly under the 'document' element in the xml file.

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Please get and list all author elements, including their child elements and attributes.
 

[TIP]
====
To print an `Element` object, you may refer to the following sample code. You will need to modify the example code to fit to your code.

[source,python]
----
print(etree.tostring(my_element, pretty_print=True).decode('utf-8'))
----
====

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Please list all codeSystem attribute values from the file.
.. Please list the codeSystem value for which the 'displayName' attribute contains the string 'DOSAGE'.

[TIP]
====
You can use the `.attrib` attribute to access the attributes of an `Element`. It is a dict-like object, so you can access the attributes similarly to how you would access the values in a dictionary.
