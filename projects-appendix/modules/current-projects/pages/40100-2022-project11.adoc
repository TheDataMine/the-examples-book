= TDM 40100: Project 11 -- 2022

**Motivation:** In general, scraping data from websites has always been a popular topic in The Data Mine. In addition, it was one of the requested topics. For the remaining projects, we will be doing some scraping of housing data, and potentially: `sqlite3`, containerization, and analysis work as well.

**Context:** This is the second in a series of 4 projects with a focus on web scraping that incorporates of variety of skills we've touched on in previous data mine courses. For this second project, we continue to build our suite of tools designed to scrape public housing data. 

**Scope:** selenium, Python, web scraping 

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use selenium to interact with a web page prior to scraping.
- Use selenium and xpath expressions to efficiently scrape targeted data.
****

== Questions

=== Question 1

If you did not complete the previous project, we will provide you with the code for the `get_links` function on Monday, November 14th, below.

[source,python]
----

----

There is a _lot_ of rich data on a home's page. If you want to gauge the housing market in an area or for a `search_term`, there are two pieces of data that could be particularly useful: the "Price history" and "Public tax history" components of the page.

Check out https://zillow.com links for a couple different houses. 

Let's say you want to track the `date`, `event`, and `price` in a `price_history` table, and the `year`, `property_tax`, and `tax_assessment` in a `tax_history` table.

Write 2 `CREATE TABLE` statements to create the `price_history` and `tax_history` tables. In addition, create a `houses` table where the `NUMBER_zpid` is the primary key, and `html`, which will store an HTML file. You can find the id in a house's link. For example, https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2180-N-Brentwood-Cir-Lecanto-FL-34461/43641432_zpid/ has the id `43641432_zpid`. 

Use `sqlite3` to create the tables in a database called `$HOME/houses.db`. You can do all of this from within Jupyter Lab.

[source,ipython]
----
%sql sqlite:///$HOME/houses.db
----

[source,ipython]
----
%%sql

CREATE TABLE ...
----

Run the following queries to confirm and show your table schemas.

[source, sql]
----
PRAGMA table_info(houses);
----

[source, sql]
----
PRAGMA table_info(price_history);
----

[source, sql]
----
PRAGMA table_info(tax_history);

=== Question 2

Write a function called `link_to_blob` that takes a `link` and returns a `blob` of the HTML file.

. Navigate to page.
. Sleep 2 seconds.
. Scroll so elements load up. (think "Price and tax history" and clicking "See complete tax history", and clicking "See complete price history", etc.)
. Create a `.html` file and `write` the driver's `page_source` to the file.
. Open the file in `rb` mode and use the `read` method to read the file into binary format. Return the binary format object.
. Delete the `.html` file from step (1).
. Quit the driver by calling `driver.quit()`.

In addition, write a function called `blob_to_html` that accepts a blob (like what is returned from `link_to_blob`) and returns the string containing the HTML content.

Demonstrate the functions by using `link_to_blob` to get the blob for a link, and then using `blob_to_html` to get the HTML content back from the returned value of `link_to_blob`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Just print the first 500 characters of the results of `blob_to_html` to avoid cluttering your output.

=== Question 3

Write functions that accept html content (as a string) and uses the `lxml.html` package to parse the HTML content and extract the various components for our `price_history` and `tax_history` tables.

[TIP]
====
My functions returned list of lists since the `sqlite3` python package will accept that format in an `executemany` statement.
====

[TIP]
====
[source,python]
----
import lxml.html

tree = lxml.html.fromstring(blob_to_html(my_blob))
tree.xpath("blah")
----

[TIP]
====
Here is some example output from my functions -- you do not need to match this if you have a better way to do it.

[source,python]
----
my_blob = link_to_blob("https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2180-N-Brentwood-Cir-Lecanto-FL-34461/43641432_zpid/")
get_price_history(blob_to_html(my_blob))
----

.output
----
[['11/9/2022', 'Price change', 275000],
 ['11/2/2022', 'Listed for sale', 289900],
 ['1/13/2000', 'Sold', 19000]]
----

----
my_blob = link_to_blob("https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2180-N-Brentwood-Cir-Lecanto-FL-34461/43641432_zpid/")
get_tax_history(blob_to_html(my_blob))

=== Question 4

Write code that uses the `get_links` function to get a list of links for a `search_term`. Process each link in the list and insert the retrieved data into your `houses.db` database.

Once complete, run a couple queries that demonstrate that the data was successfully inserted into the database.
