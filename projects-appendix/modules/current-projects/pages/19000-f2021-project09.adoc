= STAT 19000: Project 9 -- Fall 2021
:page-mathjax: true

**Motivation:** A key component to writing efficient code is writing functions. Functions allow us to repeat and reuse coding steps that we used previously, over and over again. If you find you are repeating code over and over, a function may be a good way to reduce lots of lines of code!

**Context:** We've been learning about and using functions all year! Now we are going to learn more about some of the terminology and components of a function, as you will certainly need to be able to write your own functions soon.

**Scope:** r, functions

.Learning Objectives
****
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the following functions to solve data-driven problem(s): mean, var, table, cut, paste, rep, seq, sort, order, length, unique, etc.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Demonstrate how to use tapply to solve data-driven problems.
- Comprehend what a function is, and the components of a function in R.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law[Benford's law] has many applications, the most famous probably being fraud detection. 

[quote, wikipedia, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law']
____
Benford's law, also called the Newcomb–Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30 % of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5 % of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1 % of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on. 
____

Benford's law is given by the equation below. 

$P(d) = \dfrac{\ln((d+1)/d)}{\ln(10)}$

$d$ is the leading digit of a number (and $d \in \{1, \cdots, 9\}$)

Create a function called `benfords_law` that takes the argument `digit`, and calculates the probability of `digit` being the starting digit of a random number based on Benford's law above.

Consider `digit` to be a single value. Test your function on digit 7.

Let's make our function more user friendly. When creating functions, it is important to think where you are going to use it, and if other people may use it as well.

Adding error catching statements can help make sure your function is not used out of context.

Add the following error catching by creating an if statement that checks if `digit` is between 1 and 9. If not, use the `stop` function to stop the function, and return a message explaining the error or how the user could avoid it.

Consider `digit` to be a single value. Test your new `benfords_law` function on digit 0.

Our `benfords_law` function was created to calculate the value of a single digit. We have discussed in the past the advantages of having a vectorized function.

Modify `benfords_law` to accept a vector of leading digits. Make sure `benfords_law` stops if any value in the vector `digit` is not between 1 and 9.

Test your vectorized `benfords_law` using the following code.

[source,r]
----
benfords_law(0:5)
benfords_law(1:6)
----

[TIP]
====
There are many ways to solve this problem. You can use for loops, use the functions `sapply` or `Vectorize`. However, the simplest way may be to take a look at our `if` statement as the function `log` is already vectorized.

=== Question 4

Calculate the Benford's law for all possible digits (1 to 9). Create a graph to illustrate the results. You can use a barplot, a lineplot, or a combination of both.

Make sure you add a title to your plot, play with the colors and aesthetics of your plot. Have fun!

Now that we have and understand the theoretical probabilities of Benford's Law, how about we use it to try to find anomalies in the elections dataset?

As we mentioned previously, Benford's Law is very commonly used in fraud detection. Fraud detection algorithms looks for anomalies in datasets based on certain criteria and flag it for audit or further exploration.

Not every anomaly is a fraud, but it _is_ a good start.

We will continue this in our next project, but we can start to set things up. 

Create a function called `get_starting_digit` that has one argument, `transaction_vector`. 

The function should return a vector containing the starting digit for each value in the `transaction_vector`. 

For example, `get_starting_digit(c(10, 2, 500))` should return `c(1, 2, 5)`. Make sure that the the results of `get_starting_digit` is a numeric vector.

Test your code running the following code.

[source,r]
----
str(get_starting_digit(c(100,2,50,689,1)))
