= TDM 10200: Project 2 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas will enable us to work with data in Python.  If you were enrolled in The Data Mine in the fall semester, you will recognize some similarities to data frames from R.  If you are new to The Data Mine, you will likely find that Pandas makes it easy to work with data. Matplotlib is a widely-used Python library for creating visualizations in Python.

**Context:** This is our second project and we will continue to introduce some basic data types, basic operations using pandas and matplotlib

**Scope:** tuples, lists, pandas, matplotlib

.Learning Objectives
****
- Familiar with python data types
- Basic panda operations
- Basic matplotlib operations
****

== Dataset(s)

You will use the following dataset(s) for questions

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv`

== Readings and Resources

* Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc#option-1[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

* Please review the following Examples Book pages before you start the project, and be sure to try some of these examples!  These will help you be prepared for the project questions below.  
- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/tuples[Python tuples]
- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/lists[Python lists]

- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/matplotlib[matplotlib]


== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts) 

[loweralpha]
.. Create a list called `mydata` that contains 6 tuples.  Each tuple should have a student's first name, age and major. (You may make up the students' information.)
.. Use a https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/pandas-dataframes#dataframe-constructor[DataFrame Constructor] to convert `mydata` into a DataFrame named `studentDF`.
.. Use "iloc[]" to extract and display the second student's information in the DataFrame

[TIP]
====
You may get more information about "iloc[]" https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_iloc.asp[here] 
====

[TIP]
====
We added a https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/pandas-dataframe-constructor[video about using the Pandas Data Frame Constructor]
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

[WARNING]
====
For question 2, when you run:
[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
myDF = pd.read_csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv")
----
You need to use 3 cores in your Jupyter Lab session.  If you started your Jupyter Lab session with only 1 core, just close your Jupyter Lab session and start a new session that uses 3 cores.  Otherwise, your kernel will crash when you load the data.

We added a video about https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/starting-an-anvil-session[starting an anvil session with more cores]
====

[loweralpha]

.. Read in the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv` into a `pandas` DataFrame called `myDF`.  (Optional: If you want to, you can use the first column `id` as the DataFrame's index, but this is not required.)
.. Display the first and last five rows of the `myDF` DataFrame.

[TIP]
====
[source,python]
----
.head()
.tail()
----
====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]

.. Display how many rows and columns there are in the entire DataFrame `myDF`.
.. Display a list of all the column names in the DataFrame `myDF`.

[TIP]
====
You can revisit the functions given in Project 1, Question 5, to help with both parts of this question.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Use the data from `myDF` to answer the following questions:

[loweralpha]
.. How many vehicles have a price that is strictly larger than $6000?
.. How many vehicles are from Indiana?  How many are from Texas?
.. Display all of the regions listed in the data frame.  You can use the `unique()` method on the `region` column of `myDF`.  How many different regions appear altogether (counting each region just once)?

[TIP]
====
We added a https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/pandas-breweries-examples#breweries-per-state[video about counting the number of entries per state]  (This is a different data set than the vehicles data, but it should help guide you about how to solve Question 4, because we are still counting items per state, just using breweries instead of vehicles, but the method is the same.)
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. Plot a bar chart that illustrates the number of vehicles in each state, whose price is strictly lower than $6000.  The bar chart should show the number of each of these vehicles in each state.

[TIP]
====
We added a two part video about making such a bar chart.  See the https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/pandas-breweries-examples#part-1-video[part 1 video] and the https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/pandas-breweries-examples#part-2-video[part 2 video].  Note:  The example videos are about the number of reviews per user (instead of the number of vehicles per state), but the method is the same, and these videos should help to guide your work on Question 5.
