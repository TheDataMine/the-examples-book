= TDM 10200: Project 8 -- 2024

**Motivation:** We will continue to introduce functions and visualization


**Context:**  Write functions with visualization

**Scope:** python, functions, pandas, matplotlib, Parquet columnar storage file format

== Questions 
 

=== Question 1 (2 points)

.. Read file to a DataFrame you may name it "df", convert the 'observation_time' column to datetime datatype
.. Create 3 new columns for "year", "month" and "day" based on the column "observation_time"
.. Find out How many years of data the file contains? Calculate average monthly temperature for each year for each station 
.. Now write a function called "get_avg_temp" with a filepath to the file, and a "station_id" as input arguments. This function should return a pandas DataFrame with the average monthly temperature for every year for the specific station id 

[NOTE]
====
- For the project, we may only use values on the column of "temperature"
====
=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Let Run the function from 1d with station_id is 1, assign the output DataFrame to a variable, you may name it "avg_temp_by_month"
.. import matplotlib.pyplot, create a line plot for the average monthly temperature for station 1 over the years that file contains, you should have each line for each year in the plot
.. Now let us update the function from 1d so that besides a DataFrame, the function can also plot a graph that show at 2b

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Now let us Calculate each station's highest daily temperature for every year for each month.
.. Get the information from 3a for station id 1 and visualize the information in a bar plot. You should have information for every year in the file
.. Now write a function called "get_highest_daily_temp", the function will take a filepath for file, a station id, returns a DataFrame contains highest daily temperature for specific station for each month of each year; the function will also visualize the information in a bar plot

 

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Now let us get the wind speed data for station ID 1 for the year 2020, use 'wind_speed_mph' column
.. Visualize the distribution of wind speeds for each month for station ID 1 in the year 2020 using a box plot.
..  Write a function that takes a file path and a station_id as inputs, returns a DataFrame of 2020 wind speed data for the specified station, and visualizes the information with a box plot. 
 

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Explore the dateset and find something interesting like in wind speed, pressure or soil temperature and do some analysis, then visualize the information with different plots
.. Wrap the step to create a function and test with a station
