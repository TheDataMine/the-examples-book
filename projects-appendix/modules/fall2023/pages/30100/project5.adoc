= TDM 30100: Project 5 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Documentation is one of the most critical parts of a project. https://notion.so[There] https://guides.github.com/features/issues/[are] https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html[so] https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis[many] https://www.gitbook.com/[tools] https://readthedocs.org/[that] https://bit.ai/[are] https://clickhelp.com[specifically] https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html[designed] https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[to] https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html[help] https://pdoc.dev[document] https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor[a] https://swagger.io/[project], and each have their own set of pros and cons. Depending on the scope and scale of the project, different tools will be more or less appropriate. For documenting Python code, however, you can't go wrong with tools like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[Sphinx], or https://pdoc.dev[pdoc].

**Context:** This is the third project in a 3-project series where we explore thoroughly documenting Python code, while solving data-driven problems.

**Scope:** Python, documentation

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use Sphinx to document a set of Python code.
- Use pdoc to document a set of Python code.

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/datadownloadsAugust2023/goodreads_book_authors.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/datadownloadsAugust2023/goodreads_book_series.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/datadownloadsAugust2023/goodreads_books.json`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/datadownloadsAugust2023/goodreads_reviews_dedup.json`

== Questions



The listed datasets are fairly large, and interesting! They are `json` formatted data. Each _row_ of a single `json` file can be individually read in and processed. Take a look at a single row.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

head -n 1 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/datadownloadsAugust2023/goodreads_books.json
----

This is nice, because you can individually process a single row. Anytime you can do something like this, it is easy to break a problem into smaller pieces and speed up processing. The following demonstrates how you can read in a single line and process it.

[source,python]
----
import json

with open("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/goodreads/datadownloadsAugust2023/goodreads_books.json") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
        parsed = json.loads(line)
        print(f"{parsed['isbn']=}")
        print(f"{parsed['num_pages']=}")
        break
----

In this project, the overall goal will be to implement functions that perform certain operations, write the best docstrings you can, and use your choice of `pdoc` or `sphinx` to generate a pretty set of documentation.

Begin this project by choosing a tool, `pdoc` or `sphinx`, and setting up a `firstname-lastname-project05.py` module that will host your Python functions. In addition, create a Jupyter Notebook that will be used to test out your functions, and generate your documentation. At the end of this project, your deliverable will be your `.ipynb` notebook and either a series of screenshots that captures your documentation, or a PDF created by exporting the resulting webpage of documentation.

=== Question 1 (1pt)
[upperalpha]
.. In your Jupyter Notebook, run the example codes above, understand the data selected

=== Question 2 (2 pts)
[upperalpha]

.. Write a function called `scrape_image_from_url` that accepts a URL (as a string), and returns a `bytes` object of the data.
.. Write a function called `display_image_from_bytes` that display the image directly without saving image to disk.

Make sure `scrape_image_from_url` cleans up after itself and doesn't leave any image files on the filesystem.

==== `scrape_image_from_url`

. Create a variable with a temporary file name using the `uuid` package.
. Use the `requests` package to get the response.
+
[TIP]
====
[source,python]
----
import requests

response = requests.get(url, stream=True)

# then the first argument to copyfileobj will be response.raw
----
====
+
. Open the file and use the `shutil` packages `copyfileobj` method to copy the `response.raw` to the file.
. Open the file and read the contents into a `bytes` object.
+
[TIP]
====
You can verify a bytes object by: 

[source,python]
----
type(my_object)
----

.output
----
bytes
----
====
+
. Use `os.remove` to remove the image file.
. Return the bytes object.

==== `display_image_from_bytes`

. Convert the byte data into a readable image format using an image processing library
. Open and display this readable image

[TIP]
====
[source, python]
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from IPython.display import display
====

You can verify your function works by running the following:

[source,python]
----
import shutil
import requests
import os
import uuid
import hashlib

url = 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1310220028m/5333265.jpg'
my_bytes = scrape_image_from_url(url)
m = hashlib.sha256()
m.update(my_bytes)
m.hexdigest()
display_image_from_bytes(my_bytes)
----

.output

=== Question 3 (2 pts)
[upperalpha]
.. Write a Python function called `top_reviewers` that reads file `Goodreads_reviews_parsed.json` and returns the IDs of the top 5 users who have provided the most reviews. 

The following shows how to test the function

[source,python]
----
filename = "Goodreads_reviews_parsed.json"
print(top_reviewers(filename))
----

[NOTE]
====
.. When you run this code with the provided sample JSON file, the top_reviewers function will print out the IDs of the top 5 users with the most reviews. 
.. If there are ties in the number of reviews, it will return the users that appear first in the file.
====
 

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

[upperalpha]
.. Create a new function, that does something interesting with one or more of these datasets. Just like _all_ the previous functions, make sure to include detailed and clear docstrings.

 

=== Question 5 (1 pt)
[upperalpha]
.. Generate your final documentation, and assemble and submit your deliverables:

- Screenshots and/or a PDF exported from your resulting documentation web page
