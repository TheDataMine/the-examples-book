= TDM 20200: Project 2 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Web scraping is is the process of taking content off of the internet. Typically this goes hand-in-hand with parsing or processing the data. Depending on the task at hand, web scraping can be incredibly simple. With that being said, it can quickly become difficult. Typically, students find web scraping fun and empowering.

**Context:** In the previous project we gently introduced XML and xpath expressions. In this project, we will learn about web scraping, scrape data from a news site, and parse through our newly scraped data using xpath expressions.

**Scope:** Python, web scraping, XML

.Learning Objectives
****
- Review and summarize the differences between XML and HTML/CSV.
- Use the requests package to scrape a web page.
- Use the lxml package to filter and parse data from a scraped web page.
****

The Washington Post is a very popular news site. Open a modern browser (preferably Firefox or Chrome), and navigate to https://www.washingtonpost.com.

[NOTE]
====
Throughout this project, I will be referencing text and tools from Firefox. If you want the easiest experience, I'd recommend using Firefox for at least this project.
====

By the end of this project you will be able to scrape some data from this website! The first step is to explore the structure of the website.

To begin exploring the website structure right click on the webpage and select "View Page Source". This will pull up a page full of HTML. This is the HTML used to render the page. 

Alternatively, if you want to focus on a single element on the web page, for example, an article title, right click on the title and select "Inspect". This will pull up an inspector that allows you to see portions of the HTML.

Click around on the website and explore the HTML however you like. 

Open a few of the articles shown on the front page of the paper. Note how many of the articles start with some key information like: category, article title, picture, picture caption, authors, article datetime, etc.

For example:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/19/free-n95-masks/

image::figure33.webp[Article components, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Article components"]

Copy and paste the `header` element that is 1 level nested in the `main` element into a markdown cell in an HTML code block. Include _just_ the tag with the attributes -- don't include the elements nested within the `header` element.

List the _keys_ of the _attributes_ of the `header` element. What are the _values_ of the _attributes_ of the `header` element?

Do the same for the `article` element that is 1 level nested in the `main` element (after the `header` element).

In question (1) we copied two elements of an article. When scraping data from a website, it is important to continually consider the patterns in the structure. Specifically, it is important to consider whether or not the defining characteristics you use to parse the scraped data will continue to be in the same format for new data. What do I mean by defining characterstic? I mean some combination of tag, attribute, and content from which you can isolate the data of interest.

For example, given a link to a new Washington Post article, do you think you could isolate the article title by using the `class` attribute, `class="b-l br-l mb-xxl-ns mt-xxs mt-md-l pr-lg-l col-8-lg mr-lg-l"`? Maybe, or maybe not. It looks like those classes are used to structure the size, font, and other parts of the article. In a different article those may change, or maybe they wouldn't be _unique_ within the page (for example, if another element had the same set of classes in the same page).

Take a minute to re-read the two paragraphs above. This is one of the key skills needed in order to consistently scrape data from a website. Websites change, and you need to do your best to use the parts of the webpage that are most likely to stay the same, to isolate the data you want to scrape.

Write an XPath expression to isolate the article title, and another XPath expression to isolate the article summary or sub headline.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You do _not_ need to test your XPath expression yet, we will be doing that shortly. If your solution ends up being wrong in this question, you will have a chance to fix it in the next question.
====

[NOTE]
====
Remember the goal of the XPath expression is to write it in such a way that we can take _any_ Washington Post article and extract the data we want.

Use the `requests` package to scrape the web page containing our article from questions (1) and (2). Use the `lxml.html` package and the `xpath` method to test out the XPath expressions you created in question (2). Use the expressions to extract the element, then print the _contents_ of the elements (what is between the tags). Did they work? Print the element contents to confirm. If they didn't, see the third tip below, and take the time to write new XPath expressions that work.

[TIP]
====
Check out https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/lxml#examples[these] examples for instructions on how to do this.
====

[TIP]
====
Pass `stream=True` to the `requests` package `get` method. In addition, set `resp.raw.decode_content = True` to ensure that the content is decoded properly.

[source,python]
----
resp = requests.get(some_url, stream=True)
resp.raw.decode_content = True
# etc...
----
====

[TIP]
====
If your XPath expressions included the use of the `data-*` attributes, great job! You can read about the `data-*` attributes https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/data-formats/html#attributes[here]. `data-*` attributes are _typically_ kept as a website is updated, and are therefore a fairly reliable choice when trying to isolate data from a website.

Search different articles on the same website to see if you can find the same `data-*` attributes you used to isolate the data.

Use your newfound knowledge of XPath expressions, `lxml`, and `requests` to write a function called `get_article_links` that scrapes the home page for The Washington Post, and returns 5 article links in a list.

There are a variety of ways to do this, however, make sure it is repeatable, and _only_ returns article links. 

[TIP]
====
Again, the `data-*` attributes are particularly useful for this problem.
====

[TIP]
====
Here is some skeleton code to get you started:

[source,python]
----
import lxml.html
import requests

def get_article_links():
    """
    Scrape the home page for The Washington
    Post and return 5 article links.
    """
    
    # ...
    
    return links

print(get_article_links())   
----

.example output
----

Write a function called `get_article_info` that accepts a link to an article as an argument, and prints the information in the following format:

.Example output
----
Title: White House to distribute 400 million free N95 masks starting next week
Authors: Lena H. Sun, Dan Diamond
Time: January 19, 2022 at 5:00 a.m. EST
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Of course, the Time section may change, we used the "Published" date in our solution.
====

In a loop, test out the `get_article_info` function with the links that are returned by your `get_article_links` function.

[source,python]
----
for link in get_article_links():
    print("-----------------")
    get_article_info(link)
    print("-----------------\n")
----

If your code works for all 5 articles, that is repeatable enough for now!
