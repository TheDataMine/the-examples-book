= TDM 10100: R Project 5 -- 2024

**Motivation:** So far in this class, we've been storing values to variables without really discussing any of the specifics of what's going on. In this project, we're going to do a detailed investigation of what _variables_ are, the different _types of data_ they can store, and how the _scope_ of a variable can affect its behavior.

**Context:** There will be callbacks to previous projects throughout this project. Knowledge of basic operations with reading in and working with dataframes, constructing conditionals and loops, and using vectorized functions will be used in this project.

**Scope:** Variables, types, and scoping

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Understand the concept of variables more widely
- Know the common types in R and how to use them
- Understand what scoping is and basic best practicess
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/bay_area_bike_share/baywheels/202306-baywheels-tripdata.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

A variable, at its most foundational level, is simply a _named area in memory_ that we can store values to and access values from by referencing its given name. In R, variable names are considered valid as long as they start with either an uppercase or lowercase letter in addition to not being any of the _Reserved Keywords_ built into R (examples of reserved keywords are `TRUE`, `None`, `and`, and more. A full list of reserved keywords can be https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-keywords/[found here]). Running `help(reserved)` will also print a list of reserved words in your Jupyter notebook.

To review some of the concepts we've used in previous projects, your task in this question is to perform the following basic operations and assignments using variables:

- Create a variable named `myname` and assign it the value of your name
- Create a variable named `myage` and assign it the value of your age
- Create a variable named `my_fav_colors` and assign it your top 3 favorite colors
- Create a variable named `about_me` and assign to it a list containing `myname`, `myage`, and `my_fav_colors`
- print `about_me`

.Deliverables

- The four lines of code specified above, and the results of running that code

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Alright, let's quickly review your work from the last problem. In your assignment statements, you likely used quotes around your name, nothing around your age and `c()` around your lists. But why did you do that? 

The answer: `types`. Data can come in different types, and each type of data has a specific notation used to denote it when writing it. Let's quickly run through some basic types in R:

- Characters are used to store text data like `"Hello World!"` (In other languages, these are often called _strings_, whereas characters would only refer to single character data like `"a"`)
- Integers are used to store whole number data like `5`, `1000`, or `-30`
- Numeric are used to store decimal numbers like `5.534234` or `0.1` (but can also hold whole numbers like integers can)
- Lists are used to store lists of values. In R, lists can contain different types at the same time. As demonstrated in the previous example, lists can also contain other lists!
- Booleans are logical truth values. The two main R booleans are `TRUE` and `FALSE`
- Sets, dicts, tuples and more data types also exist in R! In the next project we'll cover sets, dicts, and tuples in greater detail, as they can be very useful for organizing data. For now, just keep in mind that they exist.

That's a lot, and these are just the basic types in R! When we import a library like `tidyverse`, we also get any of the types they define! `Dataframes` are their own type as well, and each column of a dataframe also typically has a type!

Let's take a look at some real data and types. Read the Baywheels dataset (located at "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/bay_area_bike_share/baywheels/202306-baywheels-tripdata.csv") into a dataframe called `bike_data`.

Once you've read the data in, use the https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/str.html[`str()` function] to list the data type of each column. Then use `head()` to print the first few rows of our dataframe.

Read through this https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_data_types.asp[documentation page] and, in a markdown cell, give a brief description of the types of data present in our dataframe and what they are used for. You can use `ctrl+f` to search for the type on the documentation page and read the descriptions given. Write at least a sentence or two on each type in our dataframe.

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Fantastic, we've now got a feel for the different types available in our data. As a bit of an aside, let's spend this question cleaning up our data before we start experimenting on it. When you printed the head of our dataframe, you likely observed a few empty entries. Often, for some reason or another, our data won't always have every column filled in for each row. This is okay, and we will explore ways to handle missing data in future projects, but for now let's learn how to isolate the data that is complete.

First off, note the size of the dataframe currently. If you don't remember how to do this, we introduced the function in project 1. Refer to the documentation https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/dim[here] for additional help. (https://www.rdocumentation.org[rdocumentation.org] is a **fantastic** resource for R. If you get stuck it is a great place to look up what certain functions/keywords do in R.)

Next, read through https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/drop_na.html[this documentation page] to get a feel for how the `drop_na()` function works. Be sure to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see a few basic examples. Import the tidyverse library using `library(tidyverse)` and then apply the `drop_na()` function to our dataframe.

[NOTE]
====
When loading `tidyverse` with `library(tidyverse)`, you may see a warning about conflicted packages. This is due to different versions of the same code, and is an important thing to note, but will not cause any issues in the projects for this class. Go ahead and ignore it for now. If you would rather not have to see that warning in your final submission, running the cell containing `library(tidyverse)` twice will hide the warning.
====

Finally, print the size of the dataframe after dropping all the incomplete rows. How much smaller did it get? In a markdown cell, list the beginning and ending sizes of our dataframe,  how many rows were dropped for containing bad values, and what percentage of our total dataframe was dropped.

.Deliverables
====
- Size of `bike_data` before and after `drop_na()`
- Percentage of `bike_data` lost to `drop_na()`
- Number of incomplete rows in our original `bike_data` dataframe
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Now that we've read in our data, understand the types available to us, and have cleaned up our nonexisting data, let's begin analyzing it and understanding how variables interact with operators. _Generally_, it is not good practice to try and apply operatons to different variables with different types (i.e. `"hello world!" + 5`) and the R interpreter will typically stop you from doing this. Between two variables of the same type, however, many operators have defined behaviors that we haven't yet explored.

In addition, some types have their own operators that perform specific actions different from other types. For example, integers can be added together like `5 + 3`. However, in R, we can't simply add two strings like `"Hello " + "World!"`. Instead, we use the `paste()` function. Take a look at the below example of how to use paste()

[source, r]
----
var1 <- "My name is"
var2 <- "Firstname"
var3 <- "Lastname!"

sentence <- paste(var1, var2, var3)
cat(sentence)
----

The above example is one of _concatenation_, the joining of two or more strings together, and has powerful practical applications.

Let's explore the power of concatenation. Consider our bike data: if we want to figure out how many bikes we should put at each station, we'll likely need to understand which stations are used most often. Furthermore, we may want to know what trips are made most often, so that we can put more e-bicycle charging ports at spots along those trips. In order to find out what trips are made most often, we _could_ just count the number of trips that have both the same `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` _or_ we could construct a new column from those two columns, and then count our new "compound column" instead, which has the potential for making our code run a _lot_ faster.

Take a look at the below example, where I am adding the `ride_id` and `rideable_type` columns to create a new column called `id_and_type` and then getting a count of the different id-type combos in our dataframe. Using a very similar structure, combine the `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` columns into a new column called `trip_id`, and return the top 5 trip IDs in our data.

[NOTE]
====
You likely noticed that `paste()` inserts a space between each string it is concatenating. Because we don't always want to insert anything between the strings we are joining, we can simply use the `paste0()` function, which does the same thing as the `paste()` function but doesn't insert a space in between each string we are concatenating.
====

[source, r]
----
# create new column
bike_data$id_and_type <- paste0(bike_data$ride_id, "->", bike_data$rideable_type)

# print dataframe to observe new column
print(head(bike_data, 2))

# get count of top 5 values for each id-type combo in ascending order
# (note there is only one of each combo)
head(sort(table(bike_data$id_and_type), decreasing=TRUE))
----

[NOTE]
====
You may have some empty values, and that is okay! We won't worry about it for this problem, and both answers that have the empty values removed and those that don't will be accepted for full credit.

.Deliverables
====
- A new column in `bike_data` called `trip_id`
- A count of the top 5 trip IDs in the data

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

As a way to finish up this project, let's solve a problem and introduce an important concept that will be extremely relevant in the next few weeks: scope. Scope, simply put, is the level at which a variable exists. Variables with larger scope can be referenced in a wider amount of settings, whereas variables with extremely small scope may only be referenceable within the loop, function, or class that they are defined in. In R, scope really only exists in regards to functions. We'll cover functions in detail soon, but for now, just note that they are similar to loops in that they have a header (similar to `if` or `for`) and body (code within `{}` that is 'inside' the function). When variables are defined in a function, they don't exist outside that function by default. However, rather uniquely to R, variables defined in loops do exist outside the loop by default.

As a quick example, run the following code in your Jupyter notebook:

[source, r]
----
for (i in seq(5)) {
    # do nothing
}
    
# shows that i exists even after the for loop ends
print(i)

# define a function
foo = function() {
    # inside our function, define a variable then end function
    bar <- 3
}

# run our function, then try and print bar
# notice that bar does not exist outside the function's body
# so we get an error
foo()
print(bar)
----

After you run that code in your notebook, give https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/09/global-vs-local-assignment-operators-in-r-vs/[this webpage] a read. In a markdown cell, write a sentence or two about what making a variable 'global' using the global assignment operator `<\<-` does. Then, write a sentence or two about how we could use `global` to make `bar` defined, even outside of our function's body. Again, you don't have to understand deeply how functions work at this point.

.Deliverables
====
- The results of running the above code
- A sentence or two on the `<\<-` operator
- A sentence or two on how to make `bar` exist outside of `foo()`

== Submitting your Work

Now that you've completed this project, you hopefully have a much more in-depth understanding of variables and data types along with an introduction to data cleaning and variable scope! This project was quite broad, and next week we will be back to laser-focusing with a detailed investigation into dictionaries, sets, and tuples, three data types we mentioned in this project but warrant their own investigation. After that we'll be moving onto arguably the most important concept in all of code: functions.

We are getting close to halfway through the semester, so please make sure that you are getting comfortable developing a workflow for these projects and learning the concepts incrementally. A lot of these concepts are very hierarchical: they build on top of each other. If you struggled with something in this project or any of the prior ones, I would encourage you to take advantage of one of the many avenues for getting advice or the opportunity to work with one of our TAs or Dr. Ward, so that going forward you are on the best possible footing for upcoming projects. Have a great rest of your week, and I look forward to working with you all in the next project.
