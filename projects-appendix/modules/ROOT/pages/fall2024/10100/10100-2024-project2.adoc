= TDM 10100: R Project 2 -- 2024

**Motivation:** R is one of the most popular programming languages in the world for statistical and scientific analysics, and as such, it is very important to learn. While it does have many niche aspects that make it particularly suited to data analysis, it also shares a lot of common features with other programming languages. In the next few projects we will be doing a deep dive into these common features, learning about operators, variables, functions, looping and logic, and more!

**Context:** Project 1's introduction to Jupyter Notebooks will be vital here, and it will be important to understand the basics that we covered last week. Feel free to revisit Project 1 for reminders on the basics!

**Scope:** R, Operators, Conditionals

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn how to perform basic arithmetic in R
- Get familiar with conditional structures in R
- Solve a famous programming problem using math!
- Apply your problem solution to real-world data
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this project and moving forward, please use the `seminar-r` kernel, not the `seminar` kernel, unless otherwise specified. This will save us the trouble of having to include the `%%R` cell magic in every new cell, because we will be working pretty exclusively in R.
====

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

The first step to understanding and learning a new programming language is learning its `operators`, symbols that represent logical or arithmetic operations. There are a few different general types of operators, detailed below:

- arithmetic operators: perform common mathematical operations (i.e `+` is addition, `*` is multiplication, `%%` is modulus AKA remainder from division, i.e. 5%%4 is 1)
- assignment operators: assign values to variables. More on variables in next week's project, but variables are basically names that we assign values (i.e. `x \<- 6` makes the value of x, 6.) R is unique in that you can actually change the direction of assignment. `x\<-6` is the same as `6\->x`
- comparison operators: compare two values and return either `True` or `False`. (For example, `x == y` checks if x and y they are equal. `x != y` checks if x and y are not equal. `x \<= y` checks if x is less than or equal to y.)
- logical operators: these are used to create compound comparisons that can check multiple conditions. (i.e. if we wanted to make sure x was less than 5, but greater than 2, we could write `x < 5 && x > 2`)
- membership operators: these allow us to check if a list contains a specific value. If we had a list of numbers named `ourlist`, we could write `5 %in% ourlist` which would return `TRUE` if 5 is in `ourlist` and `FALSE` if it is not.

These are the basic types of operators we'll work with during this class. For a more exhaustive list, and direct examples of how to use each operator, https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_operators.asp[this website] can help give detailed descriptions of all the different operators in R.

In these next few questions, you'll be asked to write your own code to perform basic tasks using these operators. Please refer to the above linked website and descriptions for reminders on which operators are which, and how they can be used.

[NOTE]
====
In R, everything after a `#` on a line of code is considered a 'comment' by the computer. https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_comments.asp[Comments] serve as notes in your code, and don't do anything when run. It should be a priority to always comment your code well to make it understandable to an outside reader (or you, in the future!).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Precedence** is an important concept with operators, and determines which of our operators "acts first". You can think of it as being similar to the concept of arithmetic order-of-operations in math (like https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html[_PEMDAS_]). https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/precedence-associativity[This website] details operator precedence in R and is worth taking a look at before attempting the next two questions.
====

Before you attempt this question, take a minute to view the below examples. Attempt to run them on your own and observe their behavior.

[source, r]
----
a <- 5     # a is 5 (assignment)
a <- a + 1 # a is 6 (addition)
a <- a * 3 # a is 18 (multiplication)

b <- 2 * (a + 3)  # b is 42, a is still 18
c <- 2 * a + 3    # c is 39, a is still 18

d <- a > 10     # d is TRUE
e <- b < 20     # e is FALSE
f <- d && e     # f is FALSE

# print the final results of all operations (\n means new line):
cat("a:", a, "\nb:", b, "\nc:", c, "\nd:", d, "\ne:", e, "\nf:", f, "\n")
----

For this question, please complete the following tasks in a single code cell. At the very end of the code cell, please add `print(myVariable)` to print the results of your work. Some starter code has been provided below for your reference.

[source, r]
----
# create a new variable named myVariable and assign it a value of 7
myVariable <- 7

myVariable <- # multiply here
myVariable <- # subtract, then multiply here
myVariable <- # add the two values, then multiply here
myVariable <- # complete the rest of the math here

# print the final value of myVariable (a special date!)
print(myVariable)
----

. Create a new variable named `myVariable` and assign it a value of 7.
. Multiply the value of `myVariable` by the number representing your birth month.
. In one line of code, using two arithmetic operators, subtract 1 from the value of `myVariable` and then multiply it by 13
. In one line of code, using three arithmetic operators: add 3 to `myVariable`, add the day of your birth to `myVariable`, and then multiply `myVariable` by 11
. All in one line, using any operators you choose, subtract the month of your birth and the day of your birth from `myVariable`, divide it by 10, add 11, and then divide by 100. (Hint: You will need to use parentheses!)
. In a https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/[markdown cell], write a sentence describing the number you got as the value of `myVariable` at the end of all these operations. Is there anything special about it? (It may or may not be an important date from your life!)

.Deliverables
====
- A code cell containing the 5 lines of code requested above, and a print statement showing the final value of `myVariable`.
- A markdown cell identifying what is special about the resulting number.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

While we'll cover control structures in greater detail in the next few weeks, let's introduce the basic concept so we can see the **power** of logical operators when used in conditionals!

Conditionals are exactly what they sound like: blocks of code that perform actions _if_ we satisfy certain conditions. Creatively, we call these _if statements_. In R, _if statements_ are structured like so:

[source, r]
----
# general structure
if (condition) {
    do this action
}

# specific example
if (x > 0) {
    print("X is a positive number!")
}
----

For this question, we want you to use the operators we just learned to perform the following:

- define a variable `myYear`
- write an `if statement` that prints "Divisible by 4!" if `myYear` is divisible by 4
- write an `if` statement that prints "Not divisible by 100!" if `myYear` is not divisible by 100
- write an `if` statement that prints "Leap Year!" if `myYear` is divisible by 4 **AND** myYear is not divisible by 100

Here is some skeleton code to get you started (the first if statement is already completed):

[source, r]
----
myYear <- 2000

if (myYear %% 4 == 0):
    print("Divisible by 4!")
if # continue your code here...
----

To check your work, here are the following test cases:

- Year 2000 is divisible by 4 and 100
- Year 2020 is divisible by 4, but not by 100 (meaning it is a _leap year_)
- Year 1010 is not divisible by 100 or 4

.Deliverables
====
- Three _if_ statements as described above.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Let's continue to build on the foundational concept of _if_ statements. Sometimes, when our first condition is not true, we want to do something else. Sometimes we only want to do something else if _another_ condition is true. In an astounding feat of creativity, these are called _if/else/else-if_ statements, and here is their general structure:

[source, r]
----
# general structure (we can have as many else ifs as we want!)
if (condition) {
    do this
} else if (other condition) {
    do this instead
} else if (third condition) {
    do this if we meet third condition
} else {
    this is our last option
}

# we can also have no else if statements if we want!
if (condition) {
    do this
} else {
    do this instead
}

# and finally, a concrete example
x <- 5 # you can change 5 to any value you'd like!
if (x > 100) {
    print("x is greater than 100!")
} else if (x > 0) {
    print("x is a positive number less than 100!")
} else if (x < -100) {
    print("x is a less than -100!")
} else {
    print("x is a negative number greater than -100!")
}
----

Feel free to experiment with these examples, plugging in different values of `x` and seeing what happens. Learning to code is done with lots of experimentation, and exploring/making mistakes is a valuable part of that learning experience.

Let's build on your code from the last problem to create an _if/else/else-if_ statement that is able to identify any and all leap years! Below is the definition of a leap year. Your task for this question is to take the below definition and, defining a variable `myYear`, write an _if/else/else-if_ block that prints "Is a leap year!" if `myYear` is a leap year, and prints "Is not a leap year!" if `myYear` is not a leap year.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not 100, _or_ if it is divisible by 100 and 400. To put it in language that may make more sense in a conditional structure:

If a year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, it is a leap year. Else if a year is divisible by 100 and is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. Else, it is not a leap year.
====

[NOTE]
====
You will notice triple-quotes `'''` in the below example. This is another way to create comments, where anything in between `'''` is considered a comment and will be treated as such. Thus, the computer interprets `if ('''condition 1''') {` as `if () {`.
====

[source, r]
----
myYear <- 2000

if ('''condition 1''') {
    print("Is a leap year!")
} else if ('''condition 2''') {
    print("Is a leap year!")
}
else {
    print("Is not a leap year!")
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Here are some test cases for you to use to double-check that your code is working as expected.

- 2000, 2004, 2008, 2024 are all leap years
- 1700, 1896, 1900, and 2010 are all not leap years
====

.Deliverables
====
- A conditional structure to identify leap years, and the results of running it with at least one year.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Okay, we've learned a lot in this project already. Let's try and master the concepts we've been working on by making a more concise version of the conditional structure from the last problem. Here are the rules: you must create a conditional structure with only one _if_ and only one _else_. No _else ifs_ are allowed. It has to accomplish fundamentally the same task as in the previous question, and you may use the test cases provided in the previous question as a way to validate your work. Some basic skeleton code is provided below for you to build on:

[source, r]
----
myYear <- 2000

if ('''condition''') {
    print("Is a leap year!")
} else {
    print("Is not a leap year!")
}
----

.Deliverables
====
- The results of running your conditional on at least one leap year.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Great work so far. Let's summarize what we've learned. In this project, we learned about the different types of operators in R and how they are used, what conditional statements are and how they are structured, and how we can use logical and comparison operators in conditional statements to make decisions in our code!

For this last question, we are going to use what we've been building up this entire project on some real-world data and make observations based on our work! The below code has been provided to you, and contains a few new concepts we are going to cover in next week's project (namely, `for` loops and lists). For now, you don't have to understand fully what is going on. Just insert the conditions you wrote in the last problem where specified to complete the code (you only have to change lines with `===` in comments), run it, and write at least 2 sentences about the results of running your code and any observations you may have regarding that output. Include in those two sentences what percentage of the Olympics were held on leap years. (If you are interested in understanding the provided code, feel free to take some time to read the comments explaining what each line is doing.)

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Olympics data can be found at `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`
====

[NOTE]
====
In the below code, you may have noticed the addition of `.unique()` when we're getting a list of years from our data. We'll refrain from covering this in detail until a future project, but what you can know is that here it takes our list of all years and removes all the duplicate years so we have only one of each year in our resulting `year_list`
====

[source, r]
----
olympics_df <- # === read the dataset in here (see Project 1 for reminder!) ===

# get a list of each year in our olympics_df using c(), 
#   and use unique() to remove duplicate years
year_list <- unique(olympics_df$Year)
year_list <- year_list[!is.na(year_list)] # removes all NA values from our list

# create an empty list for our results
leap_list = c() 

# apply our conditional to each year in our list of years
for (year in year_list):
    if # === add your condition for leap years here === {
        # add the year to our list of leap years 
        leap_list <- append(leap_list, year)
    }

# prints our list of leap years and number of leap years
cat("The Olympics were held on leap years in:", sort(leap_list), "\n")
cat(length(leap_list), "of the", length(year_list), "Olympics occurrences in our data were held on a leap year.\n")
----

.Deliverables
====
- The results of running the completed code
- At least two sentences containing observations about the results and what percentage of Olympics are held on leap years
====

== Submitting your Work

Great job, you've completed Project 2! This project was your first real foray into the world of R, and it is okay to feel a bit overwhelmed. R is likely a new language to you, and just like any other language, it will get much easier with time and practice. As we keep building on these fundamental concepts in the next few weeks, don't be afraid to come back and revisit your previous work. As always, please ask any questions you have during seminar, on Piazza, or in office hours. We hope you have a great rest of your week, and we're excited to keep learning about R with you in the next project!
