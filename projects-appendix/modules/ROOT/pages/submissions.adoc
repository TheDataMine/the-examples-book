Unless otherwise specified, all projects *will only need 1 submitted file*:

The `.ipynb` file (based off of the provided template). See xref:submissions.adoc#how-to-download-notebook[here] to learn how to download the `.ipynb` file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Output _must_ be displayed in the `.ipynb` file (unless otherwise specified). **Double check** that the output is correct _in Gradescope_. You are responsible for all work submitted in Gradescope. If your submission does not render properly, please contact a TA for help. 

You will be graded on the work and how it is rendered in Gradescope, _not_ how it renders on https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu

Please see xref:submissions.adoc#double-checking-submissions[here] to learn how to properly double check your submission and make sure it renders properly in Gradescope.

== How to download notebook

First make sure you are in Jupyter Lab on https://notebook.anvilcloud.rcac.purdue.edu

It should look something like the following:

To download your notebook (`.ipynb` file), click on menu:File[Download] and select where you'd like to save the file. Then, when uploading your submission to Gradescope, simply upload the `.ipynb` file you _just_ downloaded.

== Double checking submissions

In order to double check that your submission (namely, your `.ipynb` file) renders properly in Gradescope, first submit your project files in Gradescope. 

[TIP]
====
Don't worry, you can submit as many times as you want. The graders will always see your most recent submission.
====

Once submitted, you should be presented with a screen that looks similar to the following.

image::figure28.webp[Post submit screen, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Post submit screen"]

Click on the button in the upper right-hand corner named "Code". 

image::figure29.webp[Click "Code", width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Click Code"]

You should be presented with the same screen that your grader sees. Look at your notebook carefully to make sure your solutions appear as you intended.

== How to make a Python file

This video demonstrates how to make a Python file to submit along with the Jupyter Lab file for your projects.  (This is not needed for most projects.  For most projects, starting in fall 2024, only the Jupyter Lab ".ipynb" file is needed.)

[TIP]
====
When uploading to Gradescope, make sure that you upload your `.ipynb` file for the project (and any other files requested), all at once.  Gradescope will only remember the most recent upload, so you need to upload all 3 files at one time, i.e., in one batch upload.
