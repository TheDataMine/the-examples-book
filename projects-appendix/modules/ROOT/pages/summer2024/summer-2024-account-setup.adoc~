= Think Summer: Introduction -- 2023

== Submission

Students need to submit the following file **by 10:00PM EST** through Gradescope inside Brightspace.

. A Jupyter notebook (a `.ipynb` file).

We've provided you with a template notebook for you to use. Please carefully read xref:summer2023/summer-2023-project-template.adoc[this section] to get started.

[CAUTION]
====
When you are finished with the project, please make sure to run every cell in the notebook prior to submitting. To do this click menu:Run[Run All Cells]. Next, to export your notebook (your `.ipynb` file), click on menu:File[Download], and download your `.ipynb` file.

== Project

**Motivation:** SQL is an incredibly powerful tool that allows you to process and filter massive amounts of data -- amounts of data where tools like spreadsheets start to fail. You can perform SQL queries directly within the R environment, and doing so allows you to quickly perform ad-hoc analyses.

**Context:** This project is specially designed for Purdue University's Think Summer program, and is coordinated by https://datamine.purdue.edu/[The Data Mine].

**Scope:** SQL, SQL in R

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to interact with popular database management systems within R.
- Solve data-driven problems using a combination of SQL and R.
- Use basic SQL commands: select, order by, limit, desc, asc, count, where, from.
- Perform grouping and aggregate data using group by and the following functions: count, max, sum, avg, like, having.
****

== Dataset

The following questions will use the `imdb` database found in Anvil, our computing cluster.

This database has 6 tables, namely:

`akas`, `crew`, `episodes`, `people`, `ratings`, and `titles`.

You have a variety of options to connect with, and run queries on our database:

. Run SQL queries directly within a Jupyter Lab cell.
. Connect to and run queries from within R in a Jupyter Lab cell.
. From a terminal in Anvil.

For consistency and simplicity, we will only cover how to do (1) and (2).

First, for both (1) and (2) you must launch a new Jupyter Lab instance. To do so, please follow the instructions below.

. Open a browser and navigate to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu, and login using your ACCESS credentials. You should be presented with a screen similar to figure (1).
+
image::figure08.webp[OnDemand, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="OnDemand"]
+
. Click on "My Interactive Sessions", and you should be presented with a screen similar to figure (2).
+
image::figure09.webp[Your interactive Anvil sessions, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Your interactive Anvil sessions"]
+
. Click on Jupyter Notebook in the left-hand menu **under "The Data Mine" section**. You should be presented with a screen similar to figure (3). Select the following settings:
+
* Allocation: cis220051
* Queue: shared
* Time in Hours: 3
* Cores: 1
* Use Jupyter Lab instead of Jupyter Notebook: Checked
+
image::figure10.webp[Jupyter Lab settings, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Jupyter Lab settings"]
+
. When satisfied, click btn:[Launch], and wait for a minute. In a few moments, you should be presented with a screen similar to figure (4).
+
image::figure11.webp[Jupyter Lab ready to connect, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Jupyter Lab ready to connect"]
+
. When you are ready, click btn:[Connect to Jupyter]. A new browser tab will launch and you will be presented with a screen similar to figure (5).
+
image::figure12.webp[Kernel menu, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Kernel menu"]
+
. Under the "Notebook" menu, please select the btn:[seminar] (look for the big "S"; we do not want btn:[seminar-r]). Finally, you will be presented with a screen similar to figure (6). 
+

+
You now have a running Jupyter Lab notebook ready for you to use. This Jupyter Lab instance is running on the https://anvil.rcac.purdue.edu[Anvil cluster]. By using OnDemand, you've essentially carved out a small portion of the compute power to use. Congratulations! Now please follow along below depending on whether you'd like to do <<option-1,option (1)>> or <<option-2,option (2)>>.

[#option-1]
To run queries directly in a Jupyter Lab cell (1), please do the following.

. In the first cell, run the following code. This code establishes a connection to the `imdb.db` database, which allows you to directly run SQL queries in a cell as long as that cell has `%%sql` at the top of the cell.
+
[source, ipynb]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----
+ 
. After running that cell (for example, using kbd:[Ctrl+Enter]), you can directly run future queries in each cell by starting the cell with `%%sql` in the first line. For example.
+
[source, sql]
----
%%sql

SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----
+
While this method has its advantages, there are some advantages to having interop between R and SQL -- for example, you could quickly create cool graphics using data in the database and R. 

[#option-2]
To run queries from within R (2), please do the following.

. You can directly run R code in any cell that starts with `%%R` in the first line. For example.
+
[source,r]
----
%%R

my_vec <- c(1,2,3)
my_vec
----
+
Now, because we are able to run R code, we can connect to the database, make queries, and build plots, all in a single cell. For example.
+
[source,r]
----
%%R

library(RSQLite)
library(ggplot2)

conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db")
myDF <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;")

ggplot(myDF) +
    geom_point(aes(x=primary_title, y=runtime_minutes)) +
    labs(x = 'Title', y= 'Minutes') 
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
It is perfectly acceptable to mix and match SQL cells and R cells in your project.
