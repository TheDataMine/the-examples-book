= Think Summer: Project 2 -- 2023

== How many crews include Meryl Streep in the role of `actress`?  In how many crews does she have the role of `self`?

== In which years did more than 300000 titles have their premieres?  Hint:  Use the `titles` table, and `GROUP BY` the year `premiered` and use the condition `HAVING COUNT(*) > 300000` at the end of the query.

== How many `tvSeries` have rating 9 or higher and have at least 1 million votes?

== For how many movies has Julia Roberts been on the `crew`?

== What are the 4 most popular episodes of the Sopranos?  Please include the title of each episode.  Please verify your answer by double-checking with IMDB.

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!  Just be sure to explain what you did in your solution.)

Hint:  When you join the `episodes` table and the `ratings` table, you might want to add the condition `e.episode_title_id = r.title_id` so that you can get the titles of the episodes.

== Revisiting the question about Meryl Streep:  What are the titles in which Meryl Streep had the role of `actress` and the rating was 8.5 or higher?

== Revisiting the question about the `tvSeries` that have rating 9 or higher and have at least 1 million votes: please find the `primary_title` of these `tvSeries`.

== Revisiting the question about how many movies has Julia Roberts been on the `crew`:  Which movie(s) is/are her most popular?

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!  Again, just be sure to explain what you did in your solution.)
