= Think Summer: Project 4 -- 2024

=== Question 1

For the show the Gilmore Girls, there are 7 seasons listed in the IMDB database.  Find the average rating of each of the seven seasons.  Hint:  Use `AVG` for find the average, and `GROUP BY` the `season_number`.  Make a plot or dotchart to show the average rating for each season in R.

=== Question 2

Identify the six most popular episodes of the show Grey's Anatomy (where "popular" denotes a high rating).

=== Question 3

Make a dotchart in R showing the results of the previous question.
Hint:  You can use your work from SQL, and export the results to a dataframe called `myDF` in R.  Then you can use something like:

[source,R]
----
# use a dbGetQuery here, to import the SQL results to R, and then
myresults <- myDF$rating
names(myresults) <- myDF$primary_title
dotchart(myresults)
----

=== Question 4

Make a dotchart showing the total amount of money donated in each of the top 10 states, during the 2000 federal election cycle.  Make a plot or dotchart to show the total amount of money donated in each of these top 10 states.

=== Question 5

Make a dotchart that shows how many movies premiered in each year.  You do not need to show all of the years; there are too many years!  Just show the number of movies premiered in each year since the year 2000.

=== Question 6

Among the three big New York City airports (`JFK`, `LGA`, `EWR`), which of these airports had the worst `DepDelay` (on average) in 2005?  (Can you solve this with 1 line of R, using a `tapply` (rather than using 3 separate lines of R)?  Hint: After you run the `tapply`, you can index your results using `[c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR")]` to lookup all 3 airports at once.)

=== Question 7

`LIKE` is a very powerful tool. You can read about SQLite's version of `LIKE` https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/core-functions-like.php[here].  Use `LIKE` to analyze the `primary_title` of all IMDB titles:  First determine how many titles have `Batman` anywhere in the title, and then determine how many titles have `Superman` anywhere in the title?  Which one occurs more often?

=== Question 8

How much money was donated during the 2000 federal election cycle by people who have `PURDUE` listed somewhere in their employer name?  How much money was donated by people who have `MICROSOFT` listed somewhere in their employer name?  Hint:  You might use the `grep` or the `grepl` (which is a logical grep) to solve this one.

=== Question 9

How much money was donated during the 2000 federal election cycle by people from your hometown?  (Be sure to match the city and the state.)

=== Question 10

As in Monday's project, during the years 2000 to 2020, how many people (from the people table) died in each year?  Make a plot or dotchart to show the number of people who died in each year.

=== Question 11

As in Wednesday's project, consider only the flights that arrive to Indianapolis (airport code `IND`), i.e., for which Indianapolis is the destination.  What are the 10 most popular origin airports?  Make a plot or dotchart to show the number of flights from each of these 10 most popular origin airports (with Indianapolis as the destination airport).

=== Question 12

Create your own interesting question based on the things you have learned this week.  What insights can you find?
