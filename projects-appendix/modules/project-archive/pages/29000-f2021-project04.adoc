= STAT 29000: Project 4 -- Fall 2021

== Extracting and summarizing data in bash 

**Motivation:** Becoming comfortable chaining commands and getting used to navigating files in a terminal is important for every data scientist to do. By learning the basics of a few useful tools, you will have the ability to quickly understand and manipulate files in a way which is just not possible using tools like Microsoft Office, Google Sheets, etc. While it is always fair to whip together a script using your favorite language, you may find that these UNIX tools are a better fit for your needs.

**Context:** We've been using UNIX tools in a terminal to solve a variety of problems. In this project we will continue to solve problems by combining a variety of tools using a form of redirection called piping. 

**Scope:** grep, regular expression basics, UNIX utilities, redirection, piping

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use `cut` to section off and slice up data from the command line.
- Use piping to string UNIX commands together.
- Use `sort` and it's options to sort data in different ways.
- Use `head` to isolate n lines of output.
- Use `wc` to summarize the number of lines in a file or in output.
- Use `uniq` to filter out non-unique lines.
- Use `grep` to search files effectively.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/*`
- `/depot/datamine/data/stackoverflow/processed/*`
- `/depot/datamine/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1

One of the first things to do when first looking at a dataset is reading the first few lines of data in the file. Typically, there will be some headers which describe the data, _and_ you get to see what some of the data looks like. Use the UNIX `head` command to read the first few lines of the data in `unprocessed/2011.csv`. 

As you will quickly see, this dataset is just too wide -- there are too many columns -- to be useful. Let's try and count the number of columns using `head`, `tr`, and `wc`. If we can get the first row, replace `,`'s with newlines, then use `wc -l` to count the number of lines, this should work, right? What happens?

[TIP]
====
The newline character in UNIX is `\n`.

As you can see, csv files are not always so straightforward to parse. For this particular set of questions, we want to focus on using other UNIX tools that are more useful on semi-clean datasets. Take a look at the first few lines of the data in `processed/2011.csv`. How many columns are there?

Let's switch gears, and look at a larger dataset with more data to analyze. Check out `iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.csv`. What are the 5 largest orders by number of bottles sold?

=== Question 5

Which store has the most invoices? There are 2 columns you could potentially use to solve this problem, which should you use and why? For this dataset, does it end up making a difference?

[NOTE]
====
This may take a few minutes to run. Grab a coffee. To prevent wasting time, try practicing on the `head` of the data instead of the entire data.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be _very_ careful when using `uniq`. Read the man pages for `uniq`, otherwise, you may not get the correct solution.

[source,bash]
----
man uniq
----

=== Question 6

`sort` is a particularly powerful function, albeit not always the most user friendly when compared to other tools. 

For the largest sale (in USD), what was the volume sold in liters?

For the largest sale (in liters of liquor sold), what was the total cost (in USD)?

[TIP]
====
Use the `-k` option with sort to solve these questions.

[TIP]
====
To remove a dollar sign from text using `tr`, do the following.

----
tr -d '$'
