= TDM 20200: Project 9 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is a skill that is invaluable in many fields. It can be pretty fun too! In this project, we will create plots using the `plotly` package, as well as do some data manipulation using `pandas`.

**Context:** This is the second project focused around creating visualizations in Python.

**Scope:** plotly, Python, pandas

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
- Demonstrate the ability to customize a plot (color, shape/linetype). 
****

=== Question 1

Read `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/open_food_facts/openfoodfacts.tsv` into a `pandas` dataframe, and create a bar plot using `plotly` that shows the 10 foods with the largest carbon footprint. The x-axis should be the food name, and the y-axis should be the carbon footprint value. Notice anything odd about the results? How does `plotly` handle when there are identical names in the x-axis?

[WARNING]
====
Make sure to use `fig.show(renderer='jpg')` to display your plot, otherwise, the graders will not be able to see your plot, and you will lose credit.

=== Question 2

There are 4 other specified datasets for this project. Choose one that you have not yet chosen for a previous question, wrangle the data, and use `plotly` to create a graphic that is _completely new_ from any other graphic you have created in this project. For example, for this question, you can no longer use the `openfoodfacts.tsv` dataset, and you can no longer use a bar plot. 

The resulting plot _must_ be refined -- it should have a proper, cleaned up title, proper, cleaned up x and y-axis labels, and the plot should be easy to read. Add a single markdown cell describing what the plot is showing, and what you learned from it (if anything).

=== Question 4

There are 4 other specified datasets for this project. Choose one that you have not yet chosen for a previous question, wrangle the data, and use `plotly` to create a graphic that is _completely new_ from any other graphic you have created in this project. For this question **please choose a plot from the "1D Distributions" section on https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/[this page]**.

The resulting plot _must_ be refined -- it should have a proper, cleaned up title, proper, cleaned up x and y-axis labels, and the plot should be easy to read. Add a single markdown cell describing what the plot is showing, and what you learned from it (if anything).

=== Question 5

There are 4 other specified datasets for this project. Choose one that you have not yet chosen for a previous question, wrangle the data, and use `plotly` to create a graphic that is _completely new_ from any other graphic you have created in this project. For this question **please choose a plot from any of the sections below (and including) the "3-Dimensional" section on https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/[this page]**.

The resulting plot _must_ be refined -- it should have a proper, cleaned up title, proper, cleaned up x and y-axis labels, and the plot should be easy to read. Add a single markdown cell describing what the plot is showing, and what you learned from it (if anything).
