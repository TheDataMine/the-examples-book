= TDM 10200: Project 10 -- Spring 2023


**Motivation:** Being able to create accurate and telling visualizations is a skill that we can develop. Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is an invaluable tool. 

**Context:** We are going to take a bit of a pause and work on learning some ways to create visualizations. Examine some plots, write about them, and then use your creative minds to create visualizations about the data. 


**Scope:** python, visualizing data

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

Python has several packages that help with creating data visualizations. Listed below are some of the most popular packages, these include (but are not limited to) 
* Matplotlib: a 2-D plotting library
    * Works with NumPy arrays and allows for a large number of plots to help easier understand trends and make correlations. It is *not* ideal for time series data
* Plotly: allows for the creation of easy to understand interactive plots.
    * Has 40 unique chart and plot types, but is not beginner friendly 
* GGplot: One of the more popular in the Python library It maps data and allows for attributes to be changed including color, shape, and even geometric objects. 
    * Can store data in a dataframe, you can build informative visualizations because of the different ways you can represent the data. 
* Pygal: Allows the download of visualizations into different formats. Can be used to create an interactive experience. 
    * It can become slow if it has too large of number of data points, but it allows users to still create wonderful visualizations even in complex problems.
* Geoplotlib: Buildable maps and plot geographical data using this library. It is able to use large datasets.
    * Has the ability to create various maps, including dot maps, heat maps, area maps, and point density maps.  
* Plotnine: Based on `R's` ggplot2 package, it supports the creation of complex plots from data in a dataframe. 
* Seaborn: Based on matplotlib. It can efficiently represent data that is stored in a table, array, list and other data structures.

Data visualizations are an important part of data analysis. Visualizations can summarize large amounts of data in a picture. There are many ways to choose to represent the data. Sometimes the hardest part of the analysis process is finding which chart is best to represent your data. 

Read in the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/beers.csv`. Take a moment to look at the columns and the head and tail of the data. What is some information that you could use to create a data visualization? 

Give 3 different types of information that you could show from this dataframe. Then tell which type of chart you would use and why.

Example: Show a country's beer lineup and the average ratings for each beer.

Common reasons you would use data visualizations:
    * showing change over time
    * showing part-to-whole composition
    * showing how data is distributed
    * comparing values between groups
    * observing relationships between variables
    * looking at geographical data

Using the `pycountry` library, take the `country` abbreviations and create a new column with the full country names. Rename the country column to `country_code` and the new column should be named `country_name`.

Find how many times each type of beer (in the `style` column) occurs in each country. Create a new dataframe with this information.

Make a visualization that compares beers made in eastern Europe.  

.Helpful Hint

====
Eastern European countries include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of North Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.
