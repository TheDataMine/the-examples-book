== Submission

Students need to submit the following file **by 10:00PM EST** through Gradescope inside Brightspace.

. A Jupyter notebook (a `.ipynb` file).

We've provided you with a template notebook for you to use. Please carefully read xref:summer-2023-project-template.adoc[this section] to get started.

[CAUTION]
====
When you are finished with the project, please make sure to run every cell in the notebook prior to submitting. To do this click menu:Run[Run All Cells]. Next, to export your notebook (your `.ipynb` file), click on menu:File[Download], and download your `.ipynb` file.

== Questions

=== Question 1

For the show The Handmaid's Tale (`title_id` is tt5834204), there are 4 seasons listed in the IMDB database.  Find the average rating of each of the four seasons.  Hint:  Use `AVG` for find the average, and use `GROUP BY` the `season_number`.

=== Question 3

Make a dotchart in R showing the results of the previous question.
Hint:  You can use your work from SQL, and export the results to a dataframe called `myDF` in R.  Then you can use something like:

[source,R]
----
# use a dbGetQuery here, to import the SQL results to R, and then
myresults <- myDF$rating
names(myresults) <- myDF$primary_title
dotchart(myresults)
----

=== Question 6

Among the three big New York City airports (`JFK`, `LGA`, `EWR`), which of these airports had the worst `DepDelay` (on average) in 2005?  (Can you solve this with 1 line of R, using a `tapply` (rather than using 3 separate lines of R)?  Hint: After you run the `tapply`, you can index your results using `[c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR")]` to lookup all 3 airports at once.)

=== Question 7

`LIKE` is a very powerful tool. You can read about SQLite's version of `LIKE` https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/core-functions-like.php[here].  Use `LIKE` to analyze the `primary_title` of all IMDB titles:  First determine how many titles have `Batman` anywhere in the title, and then determine how many titles have `Superman` anywhere in the title?  Which one occurs more often?

=== Question 8

How much money was donated during the 2000 federal election cycle by people who have `PURDUE` listed somewhere in their employer name?  How much money was donated by people who have `MICROSOFT` listed somewhere in their employer name?  Hint:  You might use the `grep` or the `grepl` (which is a logical grep) to solve this one.
