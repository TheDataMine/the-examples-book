= TDM 30100: Project 7 -- 2023
:page-mathjax: true

**Motivation:** Images are everywhere, and images are data! We will take some time to dig more into working with images as data in this series of projects.

**Context:** In the previous project, we learned to manipulate image's basic factors by functions from the openCV `cv2` module. In this project, we will understand key image features, detect color dominance, and perform enhancing the image's visual quality by histogram equalization technique

**Scope:** Python, images, openCV, Histogram equalization

.Learning Objectives
****
- Process images using `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `openCV`. 
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/images/ballpit.jpg`
 

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]

.. Let's work with our `ballpit.jpg` again. In project 06, we split the image into its color channels (red, green and blue). With outputs for its color channels, please find out the average values of intensity for each channel
.. Display the average values for each channel with a bar chart. Briefly explain what is your finding from the bar chart

[NOTE]
====
* The average pixel values for the 3 channels can show the whole brightness of the image, reveal which color is dominant in the image, as well as image temperature - warm (reddish), cool(blueish)
* The average values of intensity of an image is calculated by summing up the intensity values of all pixels and dividing by the total number of pixels. Intensity is the value of a pixel. For a grayscaled image, the intensity has value from Black to white; for a color image in RGB, and each pixel has 3 intensity values, for R,G and B respectively.  
====
[TIP]
====
* The average value can be calculated using numpy `mean()`
==== 

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

.. In project 06, you created a red mask for red pixels and applied the red mask to the original image. Please create another 2 masks for green and blue channels.
.. Please identify how many pixels in the image are red, green and blue (respectively), and visualize the number of pixels for the 3 channels using a combined Histogram. Briefly explain what you found from the diagrams.

[NOTE]
====
A combined histogram here means a chart with 3 bars for the 3 channels respectively. The x-axis is the 3 channels, and the y-axis is the number of pixels for each channel.
====

[NOTE]
====
* The summaries for each channel state the number of pixels for each color. So if `blue` has largest number, we can say blue is the dominant color of the image.
* To define lower and upper bounds for 3 colors depends on your personal judgement. You may need to adjust those thresholds value according to the different images and different purpose of your task.
====
[TIP]
====
`numpy sum()` can be used to summarize pixels
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. Write a function called `equal_histogram_gray` using the histogram equalized technique:
... The function will accomplish a way to enhance image area that is too dark or light by adjusting the intensity values; it will only consider intensity but not any color information.
... The input argument to the function is an image
... The function returns a tuple of two images: one is the grayscaled image, and the other is a histogram-equalized grayscaled image  

.. Run the function with "ballpit.jpg" as input. Visualize the 2 output images aligning with the original "ballpit.jpg" using a Histogram chart

[NOTE]
====
`Histogram equalization` is a technique in `digital image processing`. It is a process where the intensity values of an image are adjusted to create a higher overall contrast. 
`Digital Image Processing` is a significant aspect of data science. It is used to enhance and modify images so that their attributes are more easily understand.

You may refer to more information about `Histogram Equalization` from the following website
https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-histogram-equalization-in-python

====
[TIP]
====
* The following 2 ways can be used to convert the image "ballpit.jpg" to grayscaled image 
[source,python]
import cv2
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
IMAGE = '/anvil/projects/tdm/data/images/ballpit.jpg' 
img = mpimg.imread(IMAGE)
gray_img1 = cv2.imread(IMAGE, 0)
gray_img2= cv2.cvtColor(img.copy(), cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

* The `cv2.equalizeHist()` function will be useful to solve the question.
====  

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. Process one of your favorite photos with the function `equal_histogram_gray`.  Write 1-2 sentences about your input and output.  Make sure to show the result of the images.

Feel free to use `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/images/coke.jpg` -- the results are pretty neat!
