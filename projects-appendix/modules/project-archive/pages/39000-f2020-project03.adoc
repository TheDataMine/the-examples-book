= STAT 39000: Project 3 -- Fall 2020

**Motivation:** The ability to navigate a shell, like `bash`, and use some of its powerful tools, is very useful. The number of disciplines utilizing data in new ways is ever-growing, and as such, it is very likely that many of you will eventually encounter a scenario where knowing your way around a terminal will be useful. We want to expose you to some of the most useful `bash` tools, help you navigate a filesystem, and even run `bash` tools from within an RMarkdown file in RStudio.

**Context:** At this point in time, you will each have varying levels of familiarity with Scholar. In this project we will learn how to use the terminal to navigate a UNIX-like system, experiment with various useful commands, and learn how to execute bash commands from within RStudio in an RMarkdown file.

**Scope:** bash, RStudio

.Learning objectives
****
- Distinguish differences in /home, /scratch, and /class.
- Navigating UNIX via a terminal: ls, pwd, cd, ., .., ~, etc.
- Analyzing file in a UNIX filesystem: wc, du, cat, head, tail, etc.
- Creating and destroying files and folder in UNIX: scp, rm, touch, cp, mv, mkdir, rmdir, etc.
- Utilize other Scholar resources: rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu, notebook.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu, desktop.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu, etc.
- Use `man` to read and learn about UNIX utilities.
- Run `bash` commands from within and RMarkdown file in RStudio.
****

There are a variety of ways to connect to Scholar. In this class, we will _primarily_ connect to RStudio Server by opening a browser and navigating to https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/, entering credentials, and using the excellent RStudio interface. 

Here is a video to remind you about some of the basic tools you can use in UNIX/Linux:

This is the easiest book for learning this stuff; it is short and gets right to the point:

https://go.oreilly.com/purdue-university/library/view/-/0596002610

You just log in and you can see it all; we suggest Chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 (you can basically skip chapters 2 and 6 the first time through).

It is a very short read (maybe, say, 2 or 3 hours altogether?), just a thin book that gets right to the details.

== Questions

=== Question 1

Navigate to https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/ and login. Take some time to click around and explore this tool. We will be writing and running Python, R, SQL, and `bash` all from within this interface. Navigate to `Tools > Global Options ...`. Explore this interface and make at least 2 modifications. List what you changed.

Here are some changes Kevin likes:

- Uncheck "Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup".
- Change tab width 4.
- Check "Soft-wrap R source files".
- Check "Highlight selected line".
- Check "Strip trailing horizontal whitespace when saving".
- Uncheck "Show margin".

(Dr. Ward does not like to customize his own environment, but he does use the emacs key bindings: Tools > Global Options > Code > Keybindings, but this is only recommended if you already know emacs.)

.Items to submit
====
- List of modifications you made to your Global Options.
====

=== Question 2

There are four primary panes, each with various tabs. In one of the panes there will be a tab labeled "Terminal". Click on that tab. This terminal by default will run a `bash` shell right within Scholar, the same as if you connected to Scholar using ThinLinc, and opened a terminal. Very convenient! 

What is the default directory of your bash shell? 

[TIP]
====
Start by reading the section on `man`. `man` stands for manual, and you can find the "official" documentation for the command by typing `man <command_of_interest>`. For example:
====

[source,bash]
----
# read the manual for the `man` command
# use "k" or the up arrow to scroll up, "j" or the down arrow to scroll down
man man 
----

.Items to submit
====
- The full filepath of default directory (home directory). Ex: Kevin's is: `/home/kamstut`
- The `bash` code used to show your home directory or current directory (also known as the working directory) when the `bash` shell is first launched.
====

=== Question 3

Learning to navigate away from our home directory to other folders, and back again, is vital. Perform the following actions, in order:

- Write a single command to navigate to the folder containing our full datasets: `/class/datamine/data`. 
- Write a command to confirm you are in the correct folder. 
- Write a command to list the files and directories within the data directory. (You do not need to recursively list subdirectories and files contained therein.) What are the names of the files and directories?
- Write another command to return back to your home directory. 
- Write a command to confirm you are in the correct folder.

Note: `/` is commonly referred to as the root directory in a linux/unix filesystem. Think of it as a folder that contains _every_ other folder in the computer. `/home` is a folder within the root directory. `/home/kamstut` is the full filepath of Kevin's home directory. There is a folder `home` inside the root directory. Inside `home` is another folder named `kamstut` which is Kevin's home directory. 

.Items to submit
====
- Command used to navigate to the data directory.
- Command used to confirm you are in the data directory.
- Command used to list files and folders.
- List of files and folders in the data directory.
- Command used to navigate back to the home directory.
- Commnad used to confirm you are in the home directory.
====

=== Question 4

Let's learn about two more important concepts. `.` refers to the current working directory, or the directory displayed when you run `pwd`. Unlike `pwd` you can use this when navigating the filesystem! So, for example, if you wanted to see the contents of a file called `my_file.txt` that lives in `/home/kamstut` (so, a full path of `/home/kamstut/my_file.txt`), and you are currently in `/home/kamstut`, you could run: `cat ./my_file.txt`. 

`..` represents the parent folder or the folder in which your current folder is contained. So let's say I was in `/home/kamstut/projects/` and I wanted to get the contents of the file `/home/kamstut/my_file.txt`. You could do: `cat ../my_file.txt`. 

When you navigate a directory tree using `.` and  `..` you create paths that are called _relative_ paths because they are _relative_ to your current directory. Alternatively, a _full_ path or (_absolute_ path) is the path starting from the root directory. So `/home/kamstut/my_file.txt` is the _absolute_ path for `my_file.txt` and `../my_file.txt` is a _relative_ path. Perform the following actions, in order:

- Write a single command to navigate to the data directory.
- Write a single command to navigate back to your home directory using a _relative_ path. Do not use `~` or the `cd` command without a path argument.

.Items to submit
====
- Command used to navigate to the data directory.
- Command used to navigate back to your home directory that uses a _relative_ path.
====

=== Question 5

In Scholar, when you want to deal with _really_ large amounts of data, you want to access scratch (you can read more https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/policies/scholar/[here]). Your scratch directory on Scholar is located here: `/scratch/scholar/$USER`. `$USER` is an environment variable containing your username. Test it out: `echo /scratch/scholar/$USER`. Perform the following actions:

- Navigate to your scratch directory. 
- Confirm you are in the correct location.
- Execute `myquota`.
- Find the location of the `myquota` bash script.
- Output the first 5 and last 5 lines of the bash script. 
- Count the number of lines in the bash script.
- How many kilobytes is the script?

[TIP]
====
You could use each of the commands in the relevant topics once.
====

[TIP]
====
When you type `myquota` on Scholar there are sometimes two warnings about `xauth` but sometimes there are no warnings.  If you get a warning that says `Warning: untrusted X11 forwarding setup failed: xauth key data not generated` it is safe to ignore this error.
====

[TIP]
====
Commands often have _options_. _Options_ are features of the program that you can trigger specifically. You can see the _options_ of a command in the `DESCRIPTION` section of the `man` pages. For example: `man wc`. You can see `-m`, `-l`, and `-w` are all options for `wc`. To test this out:

[source,bash]
----
# using the default wc command. "/class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv" is the first "argument" given to the command.
wc /class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv
# to count the lines, use the -l option
wc -l /class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv
# to count the words, use the -w option
wc -w /class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv
# you can combine options as well
wc -w -l /class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv
# some people like to use a single tack `-`
wc -wl /class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv
# order doesn't matter
wc -lw /class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv
----
====

[TIP]
====
The `-h` option for the `du` command is useful.

=== Question 6

Perform the following operations:

- Navigate to your scratch directory.
- Copy and paste the file: `/class/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv` to your current directory (scratch).
- Create a new directory called `my_test_dir` in your scratch folder.
- Move the file you copied to your scratch directory, into your new folder.
- Use `touch` to create an empty file named `im_empty.txt` in your scratch folder.
- Remove the directory `my_test_dir` _and_ the contents of the directory.
- Remove the `im_empty.txt` file.

[TIP]
====
`rmdir` may not be able to do what you think, instead, check out the options for `rm` using `man rm`.
