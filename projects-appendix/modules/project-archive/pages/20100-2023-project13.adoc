= TDM 20100: Project 13 -- 2023

**Motivation:** We've covered a lot about SQL in a relatively short amount of time, but we still haven't touched on some other important SQL topics. In this project, we will touch on some other important SQL topics.

**Context:** In the previous project, you had the opportunity to take the time to insert data into a `sqlite3` database. There are still many common tasks that you may need to perform using a database: triggers, views, transaction, and even a few `sqlite3`-specific functionalities that may prove useful.

**Scope:** SQL

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a trigger on your `sqlite3` database and demonstrate that it works.
- Create one or more views on your `sqlite3` database and demonstrate that they work.
- Describe and use a database transaction. Rollback a transaction.
- Optionally, use the `sqlite3` "savepoint", "rollback to", and "release" commands.
- Optionally, use the `sqlite3` "attach" and "detach" commands to execute queries across multiple databases.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

For this project, we will be using the `lahman` sqlite database. This database contains the data in the directory  

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/lahman`

You may get some more `lahman` database information from this youtube video: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tS_-oTbsDzs[2023 SABR Analytics:Sean Lahman, "introduction to Baseball Databases"]

For every following cell where you want to run a SQL query, prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- just like we do for R or bash cells.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

.. Following the instructions to create a new column and a trigger for table "teams"
.. Update the table "teams" and display the updated information

[NOTE]
====
Begin by copying the database from the previous project to your `$HOME` directory. Open up a terminal and run the following.

[source,bash]
----
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/lahman/lahman.db $HOME
----

Go ahead and launch `sqlite3` and connect to the database from your home directory.

[source,bash]
----
sqlite3 $HOME/lahman.db
----

From within `sqlite3`, test things out to make sure the data looks right.

[source, sql]
----

SELECT * FROM teams LIMIT 5;
----
 

With any luck, things should be working just fine.

Let's go ahead and create a trigger. A trigger is what it sounds like, given a specific action, _do_ a specific action. This is a powerful tool. One of the most common uses of a trigger that you will see in the wild is the "updated_at" field. This is a field that stores a datetime value, and uses a _trigger_ to automatically update to the current date and time anytime a record in the database is updated.

First, we need to create a new column called "updated_at", and set the default value to something. In our case, lets set it to January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00. 

[source, sql]
----
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT '1970-01-01 00:00:00';
----

If you query the table now, you will see all of the values have been properly added, great!

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM teams LIMIT 5;
----

Now add a trigger called "update_teams_updated_at" that will update the "updated_at" column to the current date and time whenever a record is updated. Check out the official documentation https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html[here] for examples of triggers.

Once your trigger has been written, go ahead and test it out by updating the following record.

[source, sql]
----
UPDATE teams SET teamRank = 3 WHERE YearID = 2022 AND TEAMID ='ARI';
----

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM TEAMS WHERE YearID = 2022 AND TEAMID ='ARI' ;
----

If it worked right, your `updated_at` column should have been updated to the current date and time, cool!
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

[NOTE]
====
Next, we will touch on _views_. A view is essentially a virtual table that is created from some query and given a name. Why would you want to create such a thing? Well, there could be many reasons.

Maybe you have a complex query that you need to run frequently, and it would just be easier to see the final result with a click? Maybe the database has horrible naming conventions and you want to rename things in a view to make it more readable and/or queryable?

After some thought, it may occur to you that we've had such an instance where a view could be nice using our `lahman.db` database! 

You may get more information about "view" here: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-create-view/
====

.. Create a _view_ called "players_with_awards_2020" that will provide information for a player.  It should include the player's name, height, weight, and if the play has an award in 2020; use the year 2020 data, joining the "people" and "awardsplayers" tables.
.. Display 5 records from the view "players_with_awards_2020"
[TIP]
====
- use "playerID" to join two tables
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)


Read the official `sqlite3` documentation for transactions https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html[here]. As you will read, you've already been using transactions each time you run a query! What we will focus on is how to use transactions to _rollback_ changes, as this is probably the most useful use case you'll run into.

Connect to our "lahman.db" database from question (1), start a _deferred_ transaction, and update a row, similar to what we did before, using the following query.

[source, sql]
----
UPDATE teams SET teamRank = 30 WHERE yearID = 2022 AND teamID = 'ARI';
----

Now, query the record to see what it looks like.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM teams WHERE yearID = 2022 AND teamID ='ARI' and teamRank = 30;
----

[NOTE]
====
You'll notice our _trigger_ from before is still working, cool!
====

This is pretty great, until you realized that the teamRank was not right! Oh no! Well, at this stage you haven't committed your transaction yet, so you can just _rollback_ the changes and everything will be back to normal. Give it a try (again, following the official documentation).

After rolling back, run the following query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM teams WHERE yearID = 2022 AND teamID = 'ARI' ;
----

As you can see, the data changed back to the original one! As you can imagine, this is pretty powerful stuff, especially if you are writing to a database and want to make sure things look right before _committing_ the changes.


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

SQL and `sqlite3` are powerful tools, and we've barely scratched the surface. Check out the https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html[offical documentation], and demonstrate another feature of `sqlite3` that we haven't yet covered.

Some suggestions, if you aren't interested in browsing the documentation: https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html#biwinfunc[window functions], https://www.sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html[math functions], https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html[date and time functions], and https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html[core functions] (there are many we didn't use!)

Please make sure the queries you run are run from an sql cell in your Jupyter notebook.
