**Motivation:** The R environment is a powerful tool to perform data analysis. R is a tool that is often compared to Python. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and both are worth learning. In this project we will dive in head first and learn the basics while solving data-driven problems.

**Context:** Last project we set the stage for the rest of the semester. We got some familiarity with our project templates, and modified and ran some R code. In this project, we will continue to use R within RStudio to solve problems. Soon you will see how powerful R is and why it is often a more effective tool to use than spreadsheets.

**Scope:** r, vectors, indexing, recycling

.Learning Objectives
****
- List the differences between lists, vectors, factors, and data.frames, and when to use each.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain what "recycling" is in R and predict behavior of provided statements.
- Identify good and bad aspects of simple plots.
****

== Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset found in Scholar:

`/class/datamine/data/disney/metadata.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1

Use the `read.csv` function to load `/class/datamine/data/disney/metadata`.csvinto a `data.frame` called `myDF`. Note that `read.csv` _by default_ loads data into a `data.frame`. (We will learn more about the idea of a `data.frame`, but for now, just think of it like a spreadsheet, in which each column has the same type of data.) Print the first few rows of `myDF` using the `head` function (as in Project 1, Question 7).

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve the problem in an R code chunk.
====

=== Question 2

We've provided you with R code below that will extract the column `WDWMAXTEMP` of `myDF` into a vector. What is the 1st value in the vector? What is the 50th value in the vector? What type of data is in the vector? (For this last question, use the `typeof` function to find the type of data.)

[source,r]
----
our_vec <- myDF$WDWMAXTEMP
----

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve the problem in an R code chunk.
- The values of the first, and 50th element in the vector.
- The type of data in the vector (using the `typeof` function).
====

=== Question 3

Use the head function to create a vector called `first50` that contains the first 50 values of the vector `our_vec`. Use the tail function to create a vector called `last50` that contains the last 50 values of the vector `our_vec`.

You can access many elements in a vector at the same time. To demonstrate this, create a vector called `mymix` that contain the sum of each element of `first50` being added to the analogous element of `last50`.

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve this problem. 
- The contents of each of the three vectors.
====

=== Question 4

In (3), we were able to rapidly add values together from two different vectors. Both vectors were the same size, hence, it was obvious which elements in each vector were added together.

Create a new vector called `hot` which contains only the values of `myDF$WDWMAXTEMP` which are greater than or equal to 80 (our vector contains max temperatures for days at Disney World). How many elements are in `hot`?

Calculate the sum of `hot` and `first50`.  Do we get a warning? Read https://excelkingdom.blogspot.com/2018/01/what-recycling-of-vector-elements-in-r.html[this] and then explain what is going on. 

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve this problem. 
- 1-2 sentences explaining what is happening when we are adding two vectors of different lengths.
====

=== Question 5

Plot the `WDWMAXTEMP` vector from `myDF`.

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve this problem. 
- Plot of the `WDWMAXTEMP` vector from `myDF`.
====

=== Question 6

The following three pieces of code each create a graphic. The first two graphics are created using only core R functions.  The third graphic is created using a package called `ggplot`. We will learn more about all of these things later on. For now, pick your favorite graphic, and write 1-2 sentences explaining why it is your favorite, what could be improved, and include any interesting observations (if any).
