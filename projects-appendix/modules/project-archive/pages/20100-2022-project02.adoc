= TDM 20100: Project 2 -- 2022

**Motivation:** The ability to navigate a shell, like `bash`, and use some of its powerful tools, is very useful. The number of disciplines utilizing data in new ways is ever-growing, and as such, it is very likely that many of you will eventually encounter a scenario where knowing your way around a terminal will be useful. We want to expose you to some of the most useful UNIX tools, help you navigate a filesystem, and even run UNIX tools from within your Jupyter Lab notebook.

**Context:** At this point in time, our Jupyter Lab system, using https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu, is new to some of you, and maybe familiar to others. The comfort with which you each navigate this UNIX-like operating system will vary. In this project we will learn how to use the terminal to navigate a UNIX-like system, experiment with various useful commands, and learn how to execute bash commands from within Jupyter Lab.

**Scope:** bash, Jupyter Lab

.Learning Objectives
****
- Distinguish differences in `/home`, `/anvil/scratch`, and `/anvil/projects/tdm`.
- Navigating UNIX via a terminal: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `.`, `..`, `~`, etc.
- Analyzing file in a UNIX filesystem: `wc`, `du`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, etc.
- Creating and destroying files and folder in UNIX: `scp`, `rm`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, etc.
- Use `man` to read and learn about UNIX utilities.
- Run `bash` commands from within Jupyter Lab.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data`

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are not a `bash` user and you use an alternative shell like `zsh` or `tcsh`, you will want to switch to `bash` for the remainder of the semester, for consistency. Of course, if you plan on just using Jupyter Lab cells, the `%%bash` magic will use `/bin/bash` rather than your default shell, so you will not need to do anything.
====

[NOTE]
====
While it is not _super_ common for us to push a lot of external reading at you (other than the occasional blog post or article), https://go.oreilly.com/purdue-university/library/view/-/0596002610[this] is an excellent, and _very_ short resource to get you started using a UNIX-like system. We strongly recommend readings chapters: 1, 3, 4, 5, & 7.  It is safe to skip chapters 2, 6, and 8.
====

=== Question 1

Let's ease into this project by taking some time to adjust the environment you will be using the entire semester, to your liking. Begin by launching your Jupyter Lab session from https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu.

Open your settings by navigating to menu:Settings[Advanced Settings Editor].

Explore the settings, and make at least 2 modifications to your environment, and list what you've changed. 

Here are some settings Kevin likes:

- menu:Theme[Selected Theme > JupyterLab Dark]
- menu:Document Manager[Autosave Interval > 30]
- menu:File Browser[Show hidden files > true]
- menu:Notebook[Line Wrap > on]
- menu:Notebook[Show Line Numbers > true]
- menu:Notebook[Shut down kernel > true]

Dr. Ward does not like to customize his own environment, but he _does_ use the Emacs key bindings. 

- menu:Settings[Text Editor Key Map > emacs]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only modify your keybindings if you know what you are doing, and like to use Emacs/Vi/etc.
====

.Items to submit
====
- List (using a markdown cell) of the modifications you made to your environment.
====

=== Question 2

In the previous project, we used a tool called `awk` to parse through a dataset. This was an example of running bash code using the `f2022-s2023` kernel. Aside from use the `%%bash` magic from the previous project, there are 2 more straightforward ways to run bash code from within Jupyter Lab.

The first method allows you to run a bash command from within the same cell as a cell containing Python code. For example.

[source,ipython]
----
!ls

import pandas as pd
myDF = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
myDF.head()
----

[NOTE]
====
This does _not_ require you to have other, Python code in the cell. The following is perfectly valid.

[source,ipython]
----
!ls
!ls -la /anvil/projects/tdm/
----

With that being said, using this method, each line _must_ start with an exclamation point.
====

The second method is to open up a new terminal session. To do this, go to menu:File[New > Terminal]. This should open a new tab and a shell for you to use. You can make sure the shell is working by typing your first command, `man`. 

[source,bash]
----
# man is short for manual, to quit, press "q"
# use "k" or the up arrow to scroll up, or "j" or the down arrow to scroll down.
man man
----

Great! Now that you've learned 2 new ways to run `bash` code from within Jupyter Lab, please answer the following question. What is the _absolute path_ of the default directory of your `bash` shell? When we say "default directory" we mean the folder that you are "in" when you first run `bash` code in a Jupyter cell or when you first open a Terminal. This is also referred to as the home directory.

**Relevant topics:** https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/unix/pwd[pwd]

.Items to submit
====
- The full filepath of the default directory (home directory). Ex: Kevin's is: `/home/x-kamstut` and Dr Ward's is: `/home/x-mdw`.
- The `bash` code used to show your home directory or current directory (also known as the working directory) when the `bash` shell is first launched.
====

=== Question 3

It is critical to be able to navigate a UNIX-like operating system. It is likely that you will need to use UNIX or Linux (or a similar system) at some point in your career. Perform the following actions, in order, using the `bash` shell.

[WARNING]
====
For the sake of consistency, please run your `bash` code using the `%%bash` magic. This ensures that we are all using the correct shell (there are many shells), and that your work is displayed properly for your grader.
====

. Write a command to navigate to the directory containing the datasets used in this course: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data`.
. Print the current working directory, is the result what you expected? Output the `$PWD` variable, using the `echo` command.
. List the files within the current working directory (excluding subfiles).
. Without navigating out of `/anvil/projects/tdm/data`, list _all_ of the files within the the `movies_and_tv` directory, _including_ hidden files.
. Return to your home directory.
. Write a command to confirm that you are back in the appropriate directory.

[NOTE]
====
`/` is commonly referred to as the root directory in a UNIX-like system. Think of it as a folder that contains _every_ other folder in the computer. `/home` is a folder within the root directory. `/home/x-kamstut` is the _absolute path_ of Kevin's home directory. There is a folder called `home` inside the root `/` directory. Inside `home` is another folder named `x-kamstut`, which is Kevin's home directory.

- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 4

When running the `ls` command (specifically the `ls` command that showed hidden files and folders), you may have noticed two oddities that appeared in the output: "." and "..". `.` represents the directory you are currently in, or, if it is a part of a path, it means "this directory". For example, if you are in the `/anvil/projects/tdm/data` directory, the `.` refers to the `/anvil/projects/tdm/data` directory. If you are running the following bash command, the `.` is redundant and refers to the `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/yelp` directory.

[source,bash]
----
ls -la /anvil/projects/tdm/data/yelp/.
----

`..` represents the parent directory, relative to the rest of the path. For example, if you are in the `/anvil/projects/tdm/data` directory, the `..` refers to the parent directory, `/anvil/projects/tdm`.

Any path that contains either `.` or `..` is called a _relative path_ (because it is _relative_ to the directory you are currently in). Any path that contains the entire path, starting from the root directory, `/`, is called an _absolute path_.

. Write a single command to navigate to our modulefiles directory: `/anvil/projects/tdm/opt/lmod`.
. Confirm that you are in the correct directory using the `echo` command.
. Write a single command to navigate back to your home directory, however, rather than using `cd`, `cd ~`, or `cd $HOME` without the path argument, use `cd` and a _relative_ path.
. Confirm that you are in the corrrect directory using the `echo` command.

=== Question 5

Your `$HOME` directory is your default directory. You can navigate to your `$HOME` directory using any of the following commands.

[source,bash]
----
cd
cd ~
cd $HOME
cd /home/$USER
----

This is typically where you will work, and where you will store your work (for instance, your completed projects).

[NOTE]
====
`$HOME` and `$USER` are environment variables. You can see what they are by typing `echo $HOME` and `echo $USER`. Environment variables are variables that are set by the system, or by the user. To get a list of your terminal session's environment variables, type `env`.
====

The `/anvil/projects/tdm` space is a directory created for The Data Mine. It holds our datasets (in the `data` directory), as well as data for many of our corporate partners projects.

There exists 1 more important location on each cluster, `scratch`. Your `scratch` directory is located at `/anvil/scratch/$USER`, or, even shorter, `$SCRATCH`. `scratch` is meant for use with _really_ large chunks of data. The quota on Anvil is currently 100TB and 1 million files. You can see your quota and usage on Anvil by running the following command.

[source,bash]
----
myquota
----

[TIP]
====
`$SCRATCH` and `$USER` are environment variables. You can see what they are by typing `echo $SCRATCH` and `echo $USER`. `$SCRATCH` contains the absolute path to your scratch directory, and `$USER` contains the username of the current user.
====

In a `bash` cell, please perform the following operations.

. Navigate to your `scratch` directory.
. Confirm that you are in the correct location using a command.
. Execute the `/anvil/projects/tdm/bin/tokei` command, with input `/home/x-kamstut/bin`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Doug Crabill is the compute wizard for the Statistics department here at Purdue. `~dgc/bin` is a directory (on a different cluster) he has made publicly available with a variety of useful scripts. I've copied over those files to `~x-kamstut/bin`.
====
+
. Output the first 5 lines and last 5 lines of `~x-kamstut/bin/union`. 
. Count the number of lines in the bash script `~x-kamstut/bin/union` (using a UNIX command).
. How many bytes is the script? 
+
[CAUTION]
====
Be careful. We want the size of the script, not the disk usage. 
====
+
. Find the location of the `python3` command. 

[TIP]
====
Commands often have _options_. _Options_ are features of the program that you can trigger specifically. You can see the options of a command in the DESCRIPTION section of the man pages. 

[source,bash]
----
man wc
----

You can see -m, -l, and -w are all options for `wc`. Then, to test the options out, you can try the following examples.

[source,bash]
----
# using the default wc command. "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv" is the first "argument" given to the command.
wc /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv

# to count the lines, use the -l option
wc -l /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv

# to count the words, use the -w option
wc -w /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv

# you can combine options as well
wc -w -l /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv

# some people like to use a single tack `-`
wc -wl /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv

# order doesn't matter
wc -lw /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/1987.csv

=== Question 6

Perform the following operations.

. Navigate to your scratch directory.
. Copy the following file to your current working directory: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`.
. Create a new directory called `movies_and_tv` in your current working directory.
. Move the file, `imdb.db`, from your scratch directory to the newly created `movies_and_tv` directory (inside of scratch).
. Use `touch` to create a new, empty file called `im_empty.txt` in your scratch directory.
. Remove the directory, `movies_and_tv`, from your scratch directory, including _all_ of the contents.
. Remove the file, `im_empty.txt`, from your scratch directory.

=== Question 7

[IMPORTANT]
====
This question should be performed by opening a terminal window. menu:File[New > Terminal]. Enter the result/content in a markdown cell in your notebook.
====

Tab completion is a feature in shells that allows you to tab through options when providing an argument to a command. It is a _really_ useful feature, that you may not know is there unless you are told!

Here is the way it works, in the most common case -- using `cd`. Have a destination in mind, for example `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/`. Type `cd /anvil/`, and press tab. You should be presented with a small list of options -- the folders in the `anvil` directory. Type `p`, then press tab, and it will complete the word for you. Type `t`, then press tab. Finally, press tab, but this time, press tab repeatedly until you've selected `data`. You can then continue to type and press tab as needed.

Below is an image of the absolute path of a file in Anvil. Use `cat` and tab completion to print the contents of that file.
