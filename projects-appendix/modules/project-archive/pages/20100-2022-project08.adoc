= TDM 20100: Project 8 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database. SQL can handle much larger amounts of data than R and Python can alone. SQL is incredibly powerful. In fact, https://cloudflare.com[Cloudflare], a billion dollar company, had much of its starting infrastructure built on top of a Postgresql database (per https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22878136[this thread on hackernews]). Learning SQL is well worth your time!

**Context:** There are a multitude of RDBMSs (relational database management systems). Among the most popular are: MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql, and SQLite. As we've spent much of this semester in the terminal, we will start in the terminal using SQLite.

**Scope:** SQL, sqlite

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a database over a tool like a spreadsheet.
- Describe basic database concepts like: rdbms, tables, indexes, fields, query, clause.
- Basic clauses: select, order by, limit, desc, asc, count, where, from, etc.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

In addition, the following is an illustration of the database to help you understand the data.

image::figure14.webp[Database diagram from https://dbdiagram.io, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Database diagram from https://dbdiagram.io"]

For this project, we will be using the imdb sqlite database. This database contains the data in the directory listed above.

To run SQL queries in a Jupyter Lab notebook, first run the following in a cell at the top of your notebook to establish a connection with the database.

[source,ipython]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

For every following cell where you want to run a SQL query, prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- just like we do for R or bash cells.

== Questions

=== Question 1

++++

Get started by taking a look at the available tables in the database. What tables are available?

[TIP]
====
You'll want to prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- it should be the very first line of the cell (no comments or _anything_ else before it).

[source,ipython]
----
%%sql

-- Query here
----
====

[TIP]
====
In sqlite, you can show the tables using the following query:

[source, sql]
----
.tables
----

Unfortunately, sqlite-specific functions can't be run in a Jupyter Lab cell like that. Instead, we need to use a different query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';

It's always a good idea to get an idea what your table(s) looks like. A good way to do this is to get the first 5 rows of data from the table. Write and run 6 queries that return the first 5 rows of data of each table.

To get a better idea of the size of the data, you can use the `count` clause to get the number of rows in each table. Write an run 6 queries that returns the number of rows in each table.

[TIP]
====
Run each query in a separate cell, and remember to limit the query to return only 5 rows each.

You can use the `limit` clause to limit the number of rows returned.

This dataset contains movie data from https://imdb.com (an Amazon company). As you can probably guess, it would be difficult to load the data from those tables into a nice, neat dataframe -- it would just take too much memory on most systems!

Okay, let's dig into the `titles` table a little bit. Run the following query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

As you can see, every row has a `title_id` for the associated title of a movie or tv show (or other). What is this `title_id`? Check out the following link:

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/

At this point, you may suspect that it is the id imdb uses to identify a movie or tv show. Well, let's see if that is true. Query our database to get any matching titles from the `titles` table matching the `title_id` provided in the link above. 

[TIP]
====
The `WHERE` clause can be used to filter the results of a query.

That is pretty cool! Not only do you understand what the `title_id` means _inside_ the database -- but now you know that you can associate a web page with each `title_id` -- for example, if you run the following query, you will get a `title_id` for a "short" called "Carmencita".

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

.Output
----
title_id, type, ...
tt0000001, short, ...
----

If you navigate to https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000001/, sure enough, you'll see a neatly formatted page with data about the movie!

Okay great. Now, if you take a look at the `episodes` table, you'll see that there are both an `episode_title_id` and `show_title_id` associated with each row. 

Let's try and make sense of this the same way we did before. Write a query using the `WHERE` clause to find all rows in the `episodes` table where `episode_title_id` is `tt0903747`. What did you get?

Now, write a query using the `WHERE` clause to find all rows in the `episodes` table where `show_title_id` is `tt0903747`. What did you get?

=== Question 5

<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_hwj5ffz9?wid=_983291"></iframe>

Very interesting! It looks like we didn't get any results when we queried for `episode_title_id` with an id of `tt0903747`, but we did for `show_title_id`. This must mean these ids can represent both a _show_ as well as the _episode_ of a show. By that logic, we should be able to find the _title_ of one of the Breaking Bad episodes, in the same way we found the title of the show itself, right?

Okay, take a look at the results of your second query from question (4). Choose one of the `episode_title_id` values, and query the `titles` table to find the title of that episode.

Finally, in a browser, verify that the title of the episode is correct. To verify this, take the `episode_title_id` and plug it into the following link.

https://www.imdb.com/title/<episode_title_id>/

So, I used `tt1232248` for my query. I would check to make sure it matches this.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232248/
