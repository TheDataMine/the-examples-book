= STAT 29000: Project 2 -- Fall 2021

== Navigating UNIX and using `bash`

**Motivation:** The ability to navigate a shell, like `bash`, and use some of its powerful tools, is very useful. The number of disciplines utilizing data in new ways is ever-growing, and as such, it is very likely that many of you will eventually encounter a scenario where knowing your way around a terminal will be useful. We want to expose you to some of the most useful UNIX tools, help you navigate a filesystem, and even run UNIX tools from within your Jupyter Lab notebook.

**Context:** At this point in time, our new Jupyter Lab system, using https://gateway.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu and https://gateway.brown.rcac.purdue.edu, is very new to everyone. The comfort with which you each navigate this UNIX-like operating system will vary. In this project we will learn how to use the terminal to navigate a UNIX-like system, experiment with various useful commands, and learn how to execute bash commands from within Jupyter Lab.

**Scope:** bash, Jupyter Lab

.Learning Objectives
****
- Distinguish differences in `/home`, `/scratch`, `/class`, and `/depot`.
- Navigating UNIX via a terminal: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `.`, `..`, `~`, etc.
- Analyzing file in a UNIX filesystem: `wc`, `du`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, etc.
- Creating and destroying files and folder in UNIX: `scp`, `rm`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, etc.
- Use `man` to read and learn about UNIX utilities.
- Run `bash` commands from within Jupyter Lab.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

`/depot/datamine/data/`

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are not a `bash` user and you use an alternative shell like `zsh` or `tcsh`, you will want to switch to `bash` for the remainder of the semester, for consistency. Of course, if you plan on just using Jupyter Lab cells, the `%%bash` magic will use `/bin/bash` rather than your default shell, so you will not need to do anything.
====

[NOTE]
====
While it is not very common for us to push a lot of external reading at you (other than the occasional blog post or article), https://go.oreilly.com/purdue-university/library/view/-/0596002610[this] is an excellent, and _very_ short resource to get you started using a UNIX-like system. We strongly recommend readings chapters: 1, 3, 4, 5, & 7.  It is safe to skip chapters 2, 6, and 8.

Let's ease into this project by taking some time to adjust the environment you will be using the entire semester, to your liking. Begin by launching your Jupyter Lab session from either https://gateway.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu or https://gateway.brown.rcac.purdue.edu. 

Explore the settings, and make at least 2 modifications to your environment, and list what you've changed. 

Here are some settings Kevin likes:

- menu:Settings[JupyterLab Theme > JupyterLab Dark]
- menu:Settings[Text Editor Theme > material]
- menu:Settings[Text Editor Key Map > vim]
- menu:Settings[Terminal Theme > Dark]
- menu:Settings[Advanced Settings Editor > Notebook > codeCellConfig > lineNumbers > true]
- menu:Settings[Advanced Settings Editor > Notebook > kernelShutdown > true]
- menu:Settings[Advanced Settings Editor > Notebook > codeCellConfig > fontSize > 16]

Dr. Ward does not like to customize his own environment, but he _does_ use the Emacs key bindings. 

- menu:Settings[Text Editor Key Map > emacs]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only modify your keybindings if you know what you are doing, and like to use Emacs/Vi/etc.
====

.Items to submit
====
- List (using a markdown cell) of the modifications you made to your environment.

=== Question 2

<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_0cjqpz7p?wid=_983291"></iframe>

In the previous project, we used the `ls` command to list the contents of a directory as an example of running bash code using the `f2021-s2022` kernel. Aside from use the `%%bash` magic from the previous project, there are 2 more straightforward ways to run bash code from within Jupyter Lab.

The first method allows you to run a bash command from within the same cell as a cell containing Python code. For example.

[source,ipython]
----
!ls

import pandas as pd
myDF = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
myDF.head()
----

The second, is to open up a new terminal session. To do this, go to menu:File[New > Terminal]. This should open a new tab and a shell for you to use. You can make sure the shell is working by typing your first command, `man`. 

[source,bash]
----
# man is short for manual
# use "k" or the up arrow to scroll up, or "j" or the down arrow to scroll down.
man man
----

What is the _absolute path_ of the default directory of your `bash` shell?

**Relevant topics:** xref:book:unix:pwd.adoc[pwd]

.Items to submit
====
- The full filepath of the default directory (home directory). Ex: Kevin's is: `/home/kamstut`.
- The `bash` code used to show your home directory or current directory (also known as the working directory) when the `bash` shell is first launched.

It is critical to be able to navigate a UNIX-like operating system. It is more likely than not that you will need to use a UNIX-like system at some point in your career. Perform the following actions, in order, using the `bash` shell.

[NOTE]
====
I would recommend using a code cell with the magic `%%bash` to make sure that you are using the correct shell, and so your work is automatically saved.
====

. Write a command to navigate to the directory containing the datasets used in this course: `/depot/datamine/data/`.
. Print the current working directory, is the result what you expected? Output the `$PWD` variable, using the `echo` command.
. List the files within the current working directory (excluding subfiles).
. Without navigating out of `/depot/datamine/data/`, list _all_ of the files within the the `movies_and_tv` directory, _including_ hidden files.
. Return to your home directory.
. Write a command to confirm that you are back in the appropriate directory.

[NOTE]
====
`/` is commonly referred to as the root directory in a UNIX-like system. Think of it as a folder that contains _every_ other folder in the computer. `/home` is a folder within the root directory. `/home/kamstut` is the _absolute path_ of Kevin's home directory. There is a folder called `home` inside the root `/` directory. Inside `home` is another folder named `kamstut`, which is Kevin's home directory.

<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_4dn6j15w?wid=_983291"></iframe>
++++

When running the `ls` command, you may have noticed two oddities that appeared in the output: "." and "..". `.` represents the directory you are currently in, or, if it is a part of a path, it means "this directory". For example, if you are in the `/depot/datamine/data` directory, the `.` refers to the `/depot/datamine/data` directory. If you are running the following bash command, the `.` is redundant and refers to the `/depot/datamine/data/yelp` directory.

[source,bash]
----
ls -la /depot/datamine/data/yelp/.
----

`..` represents the parent directory, relative to the rest of the path. For example, if you are in the `/depot/datamine/data` directory, the `..` refers to the parent directory, `/depot/datamine`.

Any path that contains either `.` or `..` is called a _relative path_. Any path that contains the entire path, starting from the root directory, `/`, is called an _absolute path_.

. Write a single command to navigate to our modulefiles directory: `/depot/datamine/opt/modulefiles`
. Write a single command to navigate back to your home directory, however, rather than using `cd`, `cd ~`, or `cd $HOME` without the path argument, use `cd` and a _relative_ path.

**Relevant topics:** xref:book:unix:pwd.adoc[pwd], xref:book:unix:cd.adoc[cd], xref:book:unix:special-symbols.adoc[. & .. & ~]

=== Question 5

++++
<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_kb21hk61?wid=_983291"></iframe>

Your `$HOME` directory is your default directory. You can navigate to your `$HOME` directory using any of the following commands.

[source,bash]
----
cd
cd ~
cd $HOME
cd /home/$USER
----

This is typically where you will work, and where you will store your work (for instance, your completed projects). At the time of writing this, the `$HOME` directories on Brown and Scholar are **not** synced. What this means is, files you create on one cluster _will not_ be available on the other cluster. To move files between clusters, you will need to copy them using `scp` or `rsync`.

[NOTE]
====
`$HOME` and `$USER` are environment variables. You can see what they are by typing `echo $HOME` and `echo $USER`. Environment variables are variables that are set by the system, or by the user. To get a list of your terminal session's environment variables, type `env`.
====

The `depot` space is a network file system (as is the `home` space, albeit on a different system). It is attached to the root directory on all of the nodes in the cluster. One convenience that this provides is files in this space exist everywhere the filesystem is mounted! In summary, files added anywhere in `/depot/datamine` will be available on _both_ Scholar and Brown. Although you will not utilize this space _very_ often (other than to access project datasets), this is good information to know.

There exists 1 more important location on each cluster, `scratch`. Your `scratch` directory is located in the same place on either cluster: `/scratch/$RCAC_CLUSTER/$USER`. `scratch` is meant for use with _really_ large chunks of data. The quota on Brown is 200TB and 2 million files. The quota on Scholar is 1TB and 2 million files. You can see your quota and usage on each system by running the following command.

[source,bash]
----
myquota
----

[TIP]
====
`$RCAC_CLUSTER` and `$USER` are environment variables. You can see what they are by typing `echo $RCAC_CLUSTER` and `echo $USER`. `$RCAC_CLUSTER` contains the name of the cluster (for this course, "scholar" or "brown"), and `$USER` contains the username of the current user.
====

. Navigate to your `scratch` directory.
. Confirm you are in the correct location using a command.
. Execute the `tokei` command, with input `~dgc/bin`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Doug Crabill is a the compute wizard for the Statistics department here at Purdue. `~dgc/bin` is a directory he has made publicly available with a variety of useful scripts.
====
+
. Output the first 5 lines and last 5 lines of `~dgc/bin/union`. 
. Count the number of lines in the bash script `~dgc/bin/union` (using a UNIX command).
. How many bytes is the script? 
+
[CAUTION]
====
Be careful. We want the size of the script, not the disk usage. 
====
+
. Find the location of the `tokei` command. 

[TIP]
====
When you type `myquota` on Scholar or Brown there are sometimes warnings about xauth. If you get a warning that says something like the following warning, you can safely ignore it.

[quote, , Scholar/Brown]
____
Warning: untrusted X11 forwarding setup failed: xauth key data not generated
____ 
====

[TIP]
====
Commands often have _options_. _Options_ are features of the program that you can trigger specifically. You can see the options of a command in the DESCRIPTION section of the man pages. 

[source,bash]
----
man wc
----

You can see -m, -l, and -w are all options for `wc`. Then, to test the options out, you can try the following examples.

[source,bash]
----
# using the default wc command. "/depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv" is the first "argument" given to the command.
wc /depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv

# to count the lines, use the -l option
wc -l /depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv

# to count the words, use the -w option
wc -w /depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv

# you can combine options as well
wc -w -l /depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv

# some people like to use a single tack `-`
wc -wl /depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv

# order doesn't matter
wc -lw /depot/datamine/data/flights/1987.csv

Perform the following operations.

. Navigate to your scratch directory.
. Copy the following file to your current working directory: `/depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`.
. Create a new directory called `movies_and_tv` in your current working directory.
. Move the file, `imdb.db`, from your scratch directory to the newly created `movies_and_tv` directory (inside of scratch).
. Use `touch` to create a new, empty file called `im_empty.txt` in your scratch directory.
. Remove the directory, `movies_and_tv`, from your scratch directory, including _all_ of the contents.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This question should be performed by opening a terminal window. menu:File[New > Terminal]. Enter the result/content in a markdown cell in your notebook.
====

Tab completion is a feature in shells that allows you to tab through options when providing an argument to a command. It is a _really_ useful feature, that you may not know is there unless you are told!

Here is the way it works, in the most common case -- using `cd`. Have a destination in mind, for example `/depot/datamine/data/flights/`. Type `cd /depot/d`, and press tab. You should be presented with a large list of options starting with `d`. Type `a`, then press tab, and you will be presented with an even smaller list. This time, press tab repeatedly until you've selected `datamine`. You can then continue to type and press tab as needed.

Below is an image of the absolute path of a file in the Data Depot. Use `cat` and tab completion to print the contents of that file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this question, you will most likely want to launch a terminal. To launch a terminal click on menu:File[New > Terminal]. No need to input this question in your notebook.
====

. Use `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano` to create a new file in your scratch directory called `im_still_here.sh`. Add the following contents to the file, save, and close it.
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

i=0

while true
do
    echo "I'm still here! Count: $i"
    sleep 1
    ((i+=1))
done
----
+
. Confirm the contents of the file using `cat`.
. Try and run the program by typing `im_still_here.sh`.
+
[NOTE]
====
As you can see, simply typing `im_still_here.sh` will not work. You need to run the program with `./im_still_here.sh`. The reason is, by default, the operating system looks at the locations in your `$PATH` environment variable for executables to execute. `im_still_here.sh` is not in your `$PATH` environment variable, so it will not be found. In order to make it clear _where_ the program is, you need to run it with `./`.
====
+
. Instead, try and run the program by typing `./im_still_here.sh`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Uh oh, another warning. This time, you get a warning that says something like "permission denied". In order to execute a program, you need to grant the program execute permissions. To grant execute permissions for your program, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x im_still_here.sh
----
====
+
. Try and run the program by typing `./im_still_here.sh`.
. The program should begin running, printing out a count every second. 
. Suspend the program by typing kbd:[Ctrl+Z].
. Run the program again by typing `./im_still_here.sh`, then suspend it again.
. Run the command, `jobs`, to see the jobs you have running. 
. To continue running a job, use either the `fg` command or `bg` command. 
+
[TIP]
====
`fg` stands for foreground and `bg` stands for background. 

`fg %1` will continue to run job 1 in the foreground. During this time you will not have the shell available for you to use. To re-suspend the program, you can press kbd:[Ctrl+Z] again.

`bg %1` will run job 1 in the background. During this time the shell will be available to use. Try running `ls` to demonstrate. Note that the program, although running in the background, will still be printing to your screen. Although annoying, you can still run and use the shell. In this case, however, you will most likely want to stop running this program in the background due to its disruptive behavior. kdb:[Ctrl+Z] will will no longer suspend the program, because this program is running in the background, not foreground. To suspend the program, first send it to the foreground with `fg %1`, _then_ use kbd:[Ctrl+Z] to suspend it.
====

Experiment moving the jobs to the foreground, background, and suspended until you feel comfortable with it. It is a handy trick to learn! 

[TIP]
====
By default, a program is launched in the foreground. To run a program in the background at the start, and the command with a `&`, like in the following example.

[source,bash]
----
./im_still_here.sh &
----
====

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem. Since you will need to use kbd:[Ctrl+Z], and things of that nature, when what you are doing isn't "code", just describe what you are did. For example, if I press kbd:[Ctrl+Z], I would say "I pressed kbd:[Ctrl+Z]".
- Output from running the code.
