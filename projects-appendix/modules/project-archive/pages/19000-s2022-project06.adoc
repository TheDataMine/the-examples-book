= STAT 19000: Project 6 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** We will pause in our series of pandas and numpy projects to learn one of the most important parts of writing programs — functions! Functions allow us to reuse snippets of code effectively. Functions are a great way to reduce the repetition of code and also keep the code organized and readable.

**Context:** We are focusing on learning about writing functions in Python.

**Scope:** python, functions, pandas, matplotlib

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand what a function is.
- Understand the components of a function in python.
- Differentiate between positional and keyword arguments. 
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

[WARNING]
====
When submitting your .ipynb file for this project, if the .ipynb file doesn't render in Gradescope, please export the notebook as a PDF and submit that as well -- you will be helping the graders a lot!
====

In project 5, you read in two separate, but related datasets, and used the `pandas` `merge` method to combine them. In this project, we've provided you with a combined dataset already, called `combined.csv`.

Read in `combined.csv` into a data frame called `dat`. 

Your friend shared the following code with you.

[source,python]
----
import plotly.express as px

def plot_stations(df, *ids):
    df = df.groupby("station_id").head(1).loc[df['station_id'].isin(ids), ('station_id', 'latitude', 'longitude')]
    fig = px.scatter_geo(df, lat="latitude", lon="longitude", scope="usa", 
                     hover_name="station_id")
    fig.update_layout(geo = dict(projection_scale=7, center=dict(lat=df['latitude'].iloc[0], lon=df['longitude'].iloc[0])))
    fig.show(renderer="jpg")
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order for your plotly maps to show up properly in Gradescope, you must use the `renderer="jpg"` option. In addition, this removes the ability to zoom in on the map. The update_layout method can be safely copied and pasted into _all_ following functions you write so that the images that are rendered are zoomed in. This is critical so graders can properly see your work -- feel free to post questions in Piazza if you have questions.
====

Please do the following:

- Give a 1-2 sentence explanation of what this function does.
- Use the function to plot 2 or more stations, BUT, use the function in two different ways (with the same result). Use tuple _unpacking_ in 1 call of the `plot_stations` function, and do _not_ in the other.

[TIP]
====
I would _highly_ recommend taking the time to read through the entire article https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/[here]. It is a very detailed article going through all the things you can do with functions in Python. The section on https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/#argument-tuple-packing[tuple packing] and https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/#argument-tuple-unpacking[tuple unpacking] may be particularly useful to you!

In project 5, question 5, you wrote a function called `plot_stations` that given a data frame, would plot the locations of the stations on the map.

Modify your `plot_stations` function so that it has an argument called `weighted` that defaults to `False`. If `weighted` is `True`, then the stations will be plotted with a size proportional to the number observations at each station.

[source,python]
----
plot_stations(df) # plots all stations same size
plot_stations(df, weighted=False) # plots all stations same size
plot_stations(df, weighted=True) # plots all stations with size proportional to the number of observations for the station

There are many columns in our data frame with numeric data. Some examples are: `temperature_high`, `temperature_low`, `barometric_pressure`, `wind_speed_high`, etc. Wouldn't it be (kind of) cool to have an option in our `plot_stations` function that would weight the size of the points on the map based on those values instead of the number of observations? 

Modify the function so that it has another argument called `weight_by` that defaults to `None`. If `weight_by` is `None` (and `weighted` is `True`), the points on the plot should be sized by number of observations (like in question 2). Otherwise, `weight_by` can accept a string with the name of the column to base the point sizes on. For example: `plot_stations(dat, weighted=True, weight_by="temperature_high"` would create a plot where the size of the points are based on the _median_ value of `temperature_high` by station.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please note, if weighted is `False`, then points should not be weighted regardless of the value of `weight_by`.
====

Of course, not all of the columns in our dataset are appropriate to weight by. Please demonstrate your function works by running the following calls to `plot_stations`.

[source,python]
----
plot_stations(dat, weighted=True, weight_by="temperature_high")
plot_stations(dat, weighted=True, weight_by="temperature_low")
plot_stations(dat, weighted=True, weight_by="wind_speed_high")
plot_stations(dat, weighted=False, weight_by="barometric_pressure")
plot_stations(dat, weighted=True, weight_by=None)
----

[NOTE]
====
The wind_speed_high plot will have the most pronounced differences in size, but still rather small.

You've learned a lot about plotting maps in plotly, the `groupby` method (most likely), and hopefully functions as well!

Check out all of the datasets in the `/depot/datamine/data/flights/subset` directory. Write a function that creates _any_ new plot using some or all of the data in the `subset` directory. The plots could be maps, other plots, anything you want! The goal should be to make the function useful for exploring flight data in the provided format. Take advantage of the tuple packing and unpacking, default arguments, etc. You could even have a function _inside_ another function (a helper function). Do you best to challenge yourself and have fun. Any solid effort will receive full credit.

Write a function that accepts the WHIN weather dataset (as a data frame), and an argument _n_. This function should plot the largest _n_ distances between stations on a map. See https://plotly.com/python/lines-on-maps/[here] for examples of plotting lines on a map. 

If you are feeling very adventurous, there is a data structure called a kdtree that you can use to very efficiently find the _n_ closest or furthest points, however, this is probably not necessary as there are not _that_ many distances to calculate for this dataset.
