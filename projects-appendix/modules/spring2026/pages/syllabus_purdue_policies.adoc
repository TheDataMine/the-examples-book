== Purdue Policies & Resources

=== Class Behavior

You are expected to behave in a way that promotes a welcoming, inclusive, productive learning environment.  You need to be prepared for your individual and group work each week, and you need to include everybody in your group in any discussions.  Respond promptly to all communications and show up for any appointments that are scheduled.  If your group is having trouble working well together, try hard to talk through the difficulties--this is an important skill to have for future professional experiences.  If you are still having difficulties, ask The Data Mine staff to meet with your group.


*Purdue's Copyrighted Materials Policy:*

Among the materials that may be protected by copyright law are the lectures, notes, and other material presented in class or as part of the course. Always assume the materials presented by an instructor are protected by copyright unless the instructor has stated otherwise. Students enrolled in, and authorized visitors to, Purdue University courses are permitted to take notes, which they may use for individual/group study or for other non-commercial purposes reasonably arising from enrollment in the course or the University generally.
Notes taken in class are, however, generally considered to be "derivative works" of the instructor's presentations and materials, and they are thus subject to the instructor's copyright in such presentations and materials. No individual is permitted to sell or otherwise barter notes, either to other students or to any commercial concern, for a course without the express written permission of the course instructor. To obtain permission to sell or barter notes, the individual wishing to sell or barter the notes must be registered in the course or must be an approved visitor to the class. Course instructors may choose to grant or not grant such permission at their own discretion, and may require a review of the notes prior to their being sold or bartered. If they do grant such permission, they may revoke it at any time, if they so choose.

=== Nondiscrimination Statement
Purdue University and The Data Mine are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her potential. For details, see Purdue’s  link:https://www.purdue.edu/purdue/ea_eou_statement.php[nondiscrimination policy.]

=== Accessibility
Every member of our course should be able to access, use, and learn from the materials we share. This includes all course related digital content that we share in the course. This approach helps promote equal access for everyone at Purdue and is mandated federally by link:https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/[Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)]. 

*  Instructors will make sure all course materials shared to Brightspace, such as documents, slides, videos and audio, and images, meet accessibility guidelines and to assist you in making sure anything you share is accessible.
* Your role, as a student, is to make sure anything you post for other students to engage with is also accessible, such as peer grading, peer feedback, and discussion board posts. This expectation is built into all course assignments that require you to post to Brightspace.
* A good starting place for you is to bookmark and review the link:https://www.purdue.edu/innovativelearning/tools-resources/accessibility/digital-instructional-materials-accessibility-checklist/[Innovative Learning Accessibility Checklist] for guidance on creating accessible materials.
* When selecting materials to share on our Brightspace from Purdue Libraries catalog or databases, best practices include choosing items that:
** Can be downloaded in full
** Are available in EPUB or HTML formats
** Include alternative text for written materials or captions for audio/visual content

Purdue University strives to make learning experiences accessible to all participants. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are encouraged to contact the Disability Resource Center at: drc@purdue.edu or by phone: 765-494-1247, as soon as possible. 

If the Disability Resource Center (DRC) has determined reasonable accommodations that you would like to utilize in The Data Mine, you must send Dr. Ward (WL) or Maggie Betz (Indy) your Course Accommodation Letter. Instructions on sharing your Course Accommodation Letter can be found link:https://www.purdue.edu/drc/students/course-accommodation-letter.php[on this link.] Additionally, you are strongly encouraged to contact your instructor as soon as possible to discuss implementation of your accommodations.

=== Course Evaluation

Toward the end of this semester, you will be provided with an opportunity to give feedback on this course and your instructor. Purdue uses an online course evaluation system, and instructors will not have access to this anonymous feedback until after final grades are submitted. You will receive an official email from evaluation administrators with a link to the online evaluation site and will receive a prompt to complete the survey when you login to Brightspace. The subject line will be: Please take 2-5 minutes to complete the survey. Check your “Junk E-mail” folder occasionally to be sure the evaluation emails were not accidentally routed there. Your participation is an integral part of this course, and your feedback is vital to improving education at Purdue University. We strongly urge you to participate in the evaluation system. 

You may email feedback to us anytime at link:mailto:datamine@purdue.edu[datamine@purdue.edu]. We take feedback from our students seriously, as we want to create the best learning experience for you!  

=== General Classroom Guidance Regarding Protect Purdue 

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person is threatening the safety of others by not complying with Protect Purdue protocols is encouraged to report the behavior to and discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option of reporting the behavior to the link:purdue.edu/odos/osrr/[Office of the Student Rights and Responsibilities]. See also link:https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights[Purdue University Bill of Student Rights] and the Violent Behavior Policy under University Resources in Brightspace.
