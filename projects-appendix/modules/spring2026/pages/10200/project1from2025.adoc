== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/breyers/reviews.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/bj/products.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

For the first question in this project, let's try the first example from the kernel page:  We will load the airports data set in Python and will display the head of the airports data set.

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd
myDF = pd.read_csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv")
myDF.head()
----

Just try this Python code using the `seminar` kernel (not the `seminar-r` kernel) and make sure that you can see the first five rows of the airports data frame.

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

In Python, we often use the Pandas library for loading DataFrames.  Pandas allows us to check some properties of our data frame.  For instance, we can use the `shape` property to see how many rows and columns our DataFrame has:

[source, python]
----
myDF.shape
----

Notice that Python starts counting from 0 (as opposed to R, which starts counting from 1).  So the initial row of the Pandas DataFrame is row 0.  In the head of the DataFrame, as we saw in Question 1, we see rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Now load the tail of the DataFrame.  It displays rows 3371, 3372, 3373, 3374, 3375.  As indicated by the `shape` parameter, this DataFrame has 3376 rows altogether, so this makes sense.

[source, python]
----
myDF.tail()
----

We can select rows of the data frame that meet certain conditions.  For instance, we can extract the airports located in New York City as follows:

[source, python]
----
myDF[(myDF['city'] == 'New York') & (myDF['state'] == 'NY')]
----

Now try it yourself!  After you display the airports in New York City, then please display the airports from Indianapolis, IN.  Afterwards (separately) please display the airports from Houston, TX.  Please note that you need to specify the city and the state for this to work.  If you forget the state on the Indianapolis query, it will be OK, because no other city in the country is named Indianapolis.  BUT if you forget the state for Houston, you will get some airports that are not in Houston, TX, but instead, are from other states.  For this reason, you need to always include the conditions on the city and the state of the desired location.

*For each question in The Data Mine*, please always be sure to put some comments after your cells, which describe all of the work that you are doing in the cells, as well as your thinking and insights about the results.

[NOTE]
====
Some common Jupyter notebooks shortcuts:

- Instead of clicking the `play button`, you can press ctrl+enter (or cmd+enter on Mac) to run a cell.
- If you want to run a cell and then move immediately to the next cell, you can use shift+enter. This is oftentimes more useful than ctrl+enter
- If you want to run the current cell and then immediately create a new code cell below it, you can press alt+enter (or option+enter on Mac) to do so.
- When a cell is selected (this means you clicked next to it, and it should show a blue bar to its left to signify this), pressing the `d` key twice will delete that cell.
- When a cell is selected, pressing the `a` key will create a new code cell `a`bove the currently selected cell.
- When a cell is selected, pressing the `b` key will create a new code cell `b`elow the selected cell

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

For this question, we only pay attention to the state (not the city) for each airport.  Which state has the largest number of airports?  How many airports are located in that state?  We can extract (only) the states from each airport by writing:

[source, python]
----
myDF['state']
----

and then the `value_counts` function gives the number of airports in each state:

[source, python]
----
myDF['state'].value_counts()
----

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to make a plot of the value counts for the airports, but you are welcome to try this, if you want to!

====
- Use the `value_counts` function to find the number of airports in each state.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 3, using some comments and insights about your work.

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Now load the ice cream products data set, stored here:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/products.csv`

Using the `value_counts` function with the `brand` column from the ice cream products data set, how many rows are associated with each `brand`?  In other words, how many times does each `brand` occur in the `brand` column?

Now solve the same question with a different data set.
First load the head of the ice cream reviews data set, and then find how many times each `brand` occurs in the ice cream reviews data set:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv`

How many times does each brand occur in the `reviews.csv` data set?

You work will be similar to the work from Question 3.  Be sure to document each question with comments about your work.

.Deliverables
====
- Use the `value_counts` function to find the number of times that each `brand` occurs in the ice cream products data set.
- Then use the `value_counts` function again, to find the number of times that each `brand` occurs in the ice cream reviews data set.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Now we use `matplotlib` to display the `value_counts` from Question 4.  To accomplish this, we first load `matplotlib` as follows:

[source, python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
----

Then we can save our counts into a variable, which we choose to call `mycounts` like this:

[source, python]
----
mycounts = myDF['brand'].value_counts()
----

and finally we can plot the names of the brands (which are the `index` values in `mycounts`) on the x-axis, and the values on the y-axis, as follows:

[source, python]
----
plt.bar(mycounts.index, mycounts)
----

Give this a try yourself, with BOTH of the data sets from Question 4.

In other words, make one plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream products data set, and then make another plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream reviews data set.

.Deliverables
====
- Make one plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream products data set, and then make another plot that shows the number of occurrences of the `brand` in the ice cream reviews data set.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 5, using some comments and insights about your work.

[WARNING]
====
It is necessary to document your work, with comments about each solution.  All of your work needs to be your own work, with citations to any source that you used.  Please make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not.

**Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
