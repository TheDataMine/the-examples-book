The data set contains information about used vehicles for sale on Craiglist.

== Transformations to the original data source

Kevin originally downloaded a version of the data as `vehicles.csv` from June 2020.
In September 2022, he created a new version of the data called `vehicles_clean.csv` in which the commas between the data fields are changed to "~".

In July 2023, Mark downloaded version 10 of the data set.  To make an updated `vehicles_clean.txt` file, Mark removed all of the "~" characters and replaced each of them with a " " and then Mark removed all of the "," characters and replaced them with a "~" so that each row has 26 data fields.
