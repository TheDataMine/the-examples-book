= OKCupid

== Source

The data from the OKCupid was originally published in this journal paper:

https://openpsych.net/paper/46/

Dr Ward is not sure where we can still download the original data set; it does not seem to be available on the authors' homepages anymore.

There is also a dataset of profiles; Dr Ward is unsure of the source of this data.

== Description of the Data

This data set has information about users of the OKCupid website, including their responses to questions from the website.

== Transformations to the original data source

We created a filtered version of the data set.
