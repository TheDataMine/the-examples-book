=== Carbo-Loading: A Relational Database

Carbo-Loading contains household level transactions over a period of two years from four categories â€” pasta, pasta sauce, syrup and pancake mix. These categories were chosen so that interactions between the categories can be detected and studied.

=== The Complete Journey 2.0

This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 5,000 households who shop at a retailer. It contains all of the purchases from each household.
