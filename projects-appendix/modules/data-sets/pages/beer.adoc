== Description of the Data

The original data set from `beers.zip` has three files:

The types of beers: `beers.csv`

The locations and types of the breweries: `breweries.csv`

Reviews about the beers: `reviews.csv`

== Transformations to the original data source

In December 2020, Kevin made `parquet` versions of the three original files:

`beers.parquet`

`breweries.parquet`

`reviews.parquet`

and a small sample of the reviews, also in `parquet` format:

`reviews_sample.parquet`

and then in March 2022 he added a larger samples of the reviews, in `csv` format:

`reviews_sample.csv`
