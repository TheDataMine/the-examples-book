== Description of the Data
The description below is from Kaggle:

The Wine Type Classification Dataset contains 6,497 samples of red and white wines, with 13 features describing their chemical properties and quality. The dataset is designed for tasks such as wine type classification (red or white) and quality prediction.

The dataset has the following features:

* fixed acidity: Fixed acidity level of the wine
* volatile acidity: Volatile acidity level of the wine
* citric acid: Citric acid content
* residual sugar: Amount of residual sugar
* chlorides: Chloride content
* free sulfur dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide level
* total sulfur dioxide: Total sulfur dioxide level
* density: Density of the wine
* pH: pH level of the wine
* sulphates: Sulphate content
* alcohol: Alcohol percentage
* quality: Wine quality score (numerical)
* type: Wine type (Red or White)

This dataset is ideal for machine learning tasks such as binary classification (predicting wine type), regression (predicting quality), or exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships between chemical properties and wine characteristics. It combines data from red and white wine datasets, making it a versatile resource for researchers, data scientists, and wine enthusiasts.

This data set is a combined version of the two separate files (distinct red and white wine data sets) originally shared in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
