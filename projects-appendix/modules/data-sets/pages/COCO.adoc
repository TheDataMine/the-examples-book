= Common Objects in Context

== Source

I think that the COCO data comes from this site:
https://cocodataset.org/#download

== Description of the Data

The https://cocodataset.org/[homepage for the COCO data set] states "COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset."

We can use this dataset to demonstrate parallelization techniques. It is just the right size to be nearly impossible to do without parallelization, and also to get the "wow" factor when students get it working!

== Transformations to the original data source

Kevin downloaded this data in February 2022.  Mark is unsure if there were any transformations to this data set.
