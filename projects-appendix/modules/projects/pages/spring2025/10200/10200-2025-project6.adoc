= TDM 10100: Python Project 6 -- 2024

**Motivation:** In previous projects we've employed lists as the main way to store lots of data to a variable. However, Python gives us access to plenty of other variable types that have their own benefits and uses and provide unique advantages in data analysis that are extremely important. In this project, we'll be exploring sets, tuples, and dictionaries in Python, focusing both on learning what they are and how to use them in a practical sense.

**Context:** Understanding the basics of lists, looping, and manipulation of data in Pandas dataframes will be crucial while working through this project.

**Scope:** Lists, sets, tuples, dicts, looping structures, Pandas

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Know the differences between sets, tuples, lists, and dicts in Python
- Know when to use each type of grouping variable, and common operations for each
****

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Let's jump right into new topics with _dictionaries_. Dictionaries (and the other structures we'll be covering in this project) are essentially lists with slight modifications to their structure/properties. Conceptually, you can think of dictionaries as lists, where each element in the list is a pair of a key and a value associated with that key. For example, we may have a dictionary of names and ages for people. The keys, in this case, would be people's names, while the values would be their ages. An important thing to note is that keys **MUST** be unique - you cannot have duplicate keys - and thus using ages as the keys in our example would be much worse than using them as values. Take a look at the below code, where we make a dictionary and then print a couple of values.

[source, python]
----
# create a dictionary of names and ages
names_ages_dict = {"Mary Antoinette": 23, "Charles Darwin": 100, "Jimmy Hendrix": 45, "James Cameron": 69}

# print the age of James Cameron
print(f"James Cameron is {names_ages_dict['James Cameron']} years old")
----

For this problem, read the `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/USvideos.csv` data into a Pandas dataframe called "US_vids". Print the head of that dataframe using `.head()`. You'll notice a "category_id" column in the data. That could be useful! But we don't really have any idea what those numbers mean. In this question and the next, we'll create a new column in our dataframe that has the names of those categories.

To do this, take a look at https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-of-youtube-video-category-ids/[this website]. Create a new dictionary called id_names where the keys are the IDs and the values are the names of each category. Print the value for key 23 by indexing ino the dictionary (similar to how we did above).

.Deliverables
====
- The head of your new "US_vids" dataframe
- A dictionary with the names corresponding to each category ID. The IDs should be the dictionary keys
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Now that we have a dictionary that maps our IDs onto their names, we are ready to construct a new column in our dataframe. Luckily, Pandas provides us with a super useful method to perform this lookup and key-value matching for us: `.map()`. Read through http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.map.html[this Pandas documentation on the method], and use your `id_names` dictionary to create a new column in your dataframe called "category". Once you've done so, print the head of your dataframe to ensure that the new column has been added as you expect. (Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29794959/pandas-add-new-column-to-dataframe-from-dictionary[This Stack Overflow] post may help guide you as well)

Then use the https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html[`.value_counts()`] method to print a count of the different categories of our data, and sort it from most frequent to least frequent (Hint: We did this in Project 5, question 4).

[NOTE]
====
To validate your work, we will provide you the top 5 most frequent categories and how often they occurred:

- Entertainment: 9964
- Music: 6472
- Howto & Style: 4146
- Comedy: 3457
- People & Blogs: 3210
====

.Deliverables
====
- A new column, `category` in the dataframe `US_vids`
- A count of categories in the data, sorted by most to least frequent
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Now that we've got a working understanding of dictionaries, let's talk about _sets_. If you're familiar with "set theory" in mathematics, you likely already know about these; if not, you're about to learn! A set is similar to a list in that it contains a series of elements. However, the main difference is that sets do not contain any duplicate elements, and they have no order.

Sets are extremely useful in comparison with each other. For example, lets say I create two sets: A set of all my favorite colors and a set of all your favorite colors. If I wanted to see what colors were both my favorite and your favorite, I could find the "intersection" of those two sets. Python has a handy method that does this (and other common set operations) for us.

In this problem, we want to figure out two things:

. How often do videos with comments disabled have ratings disabled as well? 
. What overlap is there between "comedy" videos and videos that have both comments and ratings disabled?

As some guidance here, you could, for example, construct a set of videos that have comments disabled like so:

[source, python]
----
no_comment_vids = set(US_vids["video_id"][US_vids["comments_disabled"] == True])
----

You could then use, for example, `.intersection()` to compare this set to the set of videos with ratings disabled, and compare the total number of videos with comments disabled to those with comments and ratings disabled. (For a full list of set methods, https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_set.asp[click here])

[NOTE]
====
If you wanted to easily get a set of videos with both comments and ratings on, you could use the intersection of the set of videos with comments on and the set of videos with ratings on. However, you could also get the difference between the set of all videos and the set of videos with either comments, ratings, or neither enabled, but not both. There are almost always multiple ways to solve things with sets.
====

.Deliverables
====
- The proportion or percentage of videos with comments disabled that also have ratings disabled
- The proportion or percentage of "comedy" videos with both comments and ratings enabled
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Interesting. It looks like most comedy videos have most ratings and comments enabled. That makes sense, right? Comedians rely a lot on community feedback to improve their routines, so we would probably expect that they want to encourage things like leaving feedback and voting on whether they liked the video or not. However, we have a _LOT_ of categories in our data. Do you think this will hold for all the others?

In this question, we want you to create a dictionary named `category_censorship` where the keys are the names of the categories in our data, and the values are the percentage of videos in that category that have both comments and ratings enabled. We've provided some starter code for you below, and if you use your work from the last question the actual amount of new code you'll have to write will be minimal:

[source, python]
----
# create empty dictionary
category_censorship = {}

for category in set(US_vids["category"]):
    # figure out how much of the category is censored using sets
    # (Hint: This is very similar to the last problem)
    
    percent_censored = # Fill this in as needed
    
    category_censorship[category] = percent_censored
    
# fancy printing to make results look nicer
for key, val in category_censorship.items():
    print(f"{format(key, '21s')} is {format(val, '.2f')}% uncensored")
----

Be sure to print your final results for the category. If you want to make things look better, you can try and sort your dictionary based on percentage of censored videos, and even make pretty formatting for your printed results, but you don't need to in order to get full credit for this problem.

.Deliverables
====
- Your printed `category_censorship` dictionary, defined as described above.

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Let's finish up the project by discussing tuples. Tuples are very unique in that they are almost identical to lists. They are a collection of elements, they can contain elements of all the same type or different types, and they are ordered. The differences between lists and tuples, however, are quite meaningful. Once a tuple has been created, it is **immutable**, meaning it can't be changed. You can't add elements, you can't remove elements, and you can't modify elements. 

You might be wondering what the utility of tuples is at all; after all, so far the dynamic nature of data structures has been a strength, not a weakness. One of their strongest uses is one we've already been taking advantage of without really acknowledging it: data storage. When we store data in a tabular format, we have defined columns and rows, where each column stores only one type of data, and each row stores an "entry". A solid example of this would be our current Youtube data. If you were to add in some new data, you would want it to always be of some fixed length (with entries or empty spaces for each column). You could use a tuple to store each row of data, and then insert the tuple into your existing dataframe/table.

For this question your task is to create your own table. Choose some subset of the `US_vids` dataframe (for example, comedy videos only) and create a table using tuples for the rows and a list to store all the rows. Be sure that the first row in your table is made up of the column headers.

To complete the question, run the relevant section of the below code to print out the first 5 entries of your table.

[source, py]
----
# if you use a list to store your rows, run this:
for index, row in enumerate(mytable[0:5]):
    print(f"Row {index} ID: {row[0]}")

====
- A table of your own design that uses tuples to store data
- The results of running the provided print statements

== Submitting your Work

This project caps our section of the course on basic variable types and group-based variables in Python. In closing out this project, we have learned the basic variable types available to us, common use cases for each, and how we can practically apply them in order to store, access, manipulate, and analyze data in an organized and efficient manner.

In the next series of projects, we'll be diving into one of the deepest, most important parts of all of data science in Python: functions. These upcoming projects will be an amalgamation of everything you've learned so far, and once you have functions under your belt you'll really have all the basic tools native to Python that you need. Be sure you understand everything so far, as the next projects will continue to challenge and expand on what we've learned. Never hesitate to reach out for assistance as needed. See you next week!
