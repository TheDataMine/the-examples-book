== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

The first step to understanding and learning a new programming language is learning its `operators`, symbols that represent processes or math. There are a few different general types of operators, detailed below:

- arithmetic operators: perform common mathematical operations (i.e `+` is addition, `*` is multiplication, `%` is modulation AKA remainder from division, i.e. 5%4=1)
- assignment operators: assign values to variables. More on variables in next week's project, but variables are basically names that we assign values (i.e. `x = 6` makes the value of x, 6. `x += 6` makes the value of x, the current value + 6. So if x was 5, and then `x += 6` is run, x now has a value of 11)
- comparison operators: compare two values and rturn either `True` or `False`. (For example, `x == y` checks if x and y are the equal. `x != y` checks if x and y are not equal. `x <= y` checks if x is less than or equal to y.)
- logical operators: these are used to combine comparisons to check multiple conditions. (i.e. if we wanted to make sure x was less than 5, but greater than 2, we could write `x < 5 and x > 2`, or more succinctly, `2 < x < 5`)
- membership operators: these are quite unique to Python, and allow us to check, for example, if a list contains a specific value. If we had a list of numbers named `ourlist`, we could write `5 in ourlist` which would return `True` if 5 is in ourlist and `False` if it is not.

These are the basic types of operators we'll work with during this class. For a more exhaustive list, and direct examples of how to use each operator, https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp[this website] can help give detailed descriptions of all the different operators in Python.

In these next few questions, you'll be asked to write your own code to perform basic tasks using these operators. Please refer to the above linked website and descriptions for reminders on which operators are which, and how they can be used.

[NOTE]
====
In Python, everything after a `#` on a line of code is considered a 'comment' by the computer. https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp[Comments] serve as notes in your code, and don't do anything when run. It should be a priority to always comment your code well to make it understandable to an outside reader (or you, in the future!).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Precedence** is an important concept with operators, and determines which of our operators "acts first". You can think of it as being similar to the concept of PEMDAS in math. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/precedence-and-associativity-of-operators-in-python/[This table] details operator precedence in Python and is worth taking a look at before attempting the next two questions.
====

For this question, please complete the following tasks in a single code cell. At the very end of the code cell, please add `print(myVariable)` to print the results of your work. Some starter code has been provided below for your reference:

[source, Python]
----
# create a new variable named myVariable and assign it a value of 7
myVariable = 7

myVariable # multiply here
myVariable = # subtract, then multiply here
myVariable = # add the two values, then multiply here
myVariable = # complete the rest of the math here

# print the final value of myVariable (a special date!)
print(myVariable)
----

. Create a new variable named `myVariable` and assign it a value of 7.
. Using an assignment operator, multiply the value of `myVariable` by the number representing your birth month.
. In one line of code, using two arithmetic operators, subtract 1 from the value of `myVariable` and then multiply it by 13
. In one line of code, using three arithmetic operators, add 3, add the day of your birth and then multiply by 11 the value of `myVariable`
. All in one line, using any operators you choose, subtract the month of your birth and the day of your birth from `myVariable`, divide it by 10, add 11, and then divide by 100. (Hint: You may need to use parentheses!)
. In a https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/[markdown cell], write a sentence describing the number you got as the value of `myVariable` at the end of all these operations. Is there anything special about it? (It may or may not be an important date from your life!)

.Deliverables
====
- A code cell containing the 5 lines of code requested above, and a print statement showing the final value of `myVariable`.
- A markdown cell identifying what is special about the resulting number.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

While we'll cover control structures in greater detail in the next few weeks, let's introduce the basic concept so we can see the **power** of logical operators when used in conditionals!

Conditionals are exactly what they sound like: blocks of code that perform actions _if_ we satisfy certain conditions. Creatively, we call these _if statements_. In Python, _if statements_ are structured like so:

[source, python]
----
# general structure
if (condition):
    do this action

# specific example
if (x > 0):
    print("X is a positive number!")
----

For this question, we want you to use the operators we just learned to perform the following:
- define a variable `myYear`
- write an `if statement` that prints "Divisible by 4!" if `myYear` is divisible by 4
- write an `if` statement that prints "Not divisible by 100!" if `myYear` is not divisible by 100
- write an `if` statement that prints "Leap Year!" if `myYear` is divisible by 4 **AND** myYear is not divisible by 100

Here is some skeleton code to get you started (the first if statement is already completed):

[source, python]
----
myYear = 2000

if (myYear % 4 == 0):
    print("Divisible by 4!")
if # continue your code here...
----

To check your work, here are the following test cases:

- Year 2000 is divisible by 4, but not 100
- Year 2020 is a leap year
- Year 1010 is not divisible by 100 or 4

.Deliverables
====
- Three _if_ statements as described above.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Let's continue to build on the foundational concept of _if_ statements. Sometimes, when our first condition is not true, we want to do something else. Sometimes we only want to do something else if _another_ condition is true. In an astounding feat of creativity, these are called _if/else/else-if_ statements, and here is their general structure:

[NOTE]
====
In Python, `elif` stands for "else if".
====

[source, python]
----
# general structure (we can have as many elifs as we want!)
if (condition):
    do this
elif (other condition):
    do this instead
elif (third condition):
    do this if we meet third condition
else:
    this is our last option

# we can also have no elif statements if we want!
if (condition):
    do this
else:
    do this instead

# and finally, a concrete example
x = #some value
if (x > 100):
    print("x is a really big number!")
elif (x > 0):
    print("x is a positive number!")
elif (x < -100):
    print("x is a really negative number!")
else:
    print("x is a negative number")
----

Feel free to experiment with these examples, plugging in different values of `x` and seeing what happens. Learning to code is done with lots of experimentation, and exploring/making mistakes is a valuable part of that learning experience.

Let's build on your code from the last problem to create an _if/else/else-if_ statement that is able to identify any and all leap years! Below is the definition of a leap year. Your task for this question is to take the below definition, and, defining a variable `myYear`, write an _if/else/else-if_ block that prints "Is a leap year!" if `myYear` is a leap year, and prints "Is not a leap year!" if `myYear` is not a leap year.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not 100, _or_ if it is divisible by 100 and 400. To put it in language that may make more sense in a conditional structure:

If a year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, it is a leap year. Else if a year is divisible by 100 and is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. Else, it is not a leap year.
====

[source, python]
----
myYear = 2000

if # condition 1:
    print("Is a leap year!")
elif # condition 2:
    print("Is a leap year!")
else:
    print("Is not a leap year!")
----

[NOTE]
====
Here are some test cases for you to use to double-check that your code is working as expected.
- 2000, 2004, 2008, 2024 are all leap years
- 1700, 1896, 1900, and 2010 are all not leap years
====

.Deliverables
====
- A conditional structure to identify leap years, and the results of running it with at least one year.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Okay, we've learned a lot in this project already. Let's try and master the concepts we've been working on by making a more concise version of the conditional structure from the last problem. Here are the rules: you must create a conditional structure with only one _if_ and only one _else_. No _elifs_ are allowed. It has to accomplish fundamentally the same task as in the previous question, and you may use the test cases provided in the previous question as a way to validate your work. Some basic skeleton code is provided below for you to build on:

[source, python]
----
myYear = 2000

if # condition
    print("Is a leap year!")
else:
    print("Is not a leap year!")
----

.Deliverables
====
- A shortened version of the conditional structure from the last problem, and the results of running it with at least one year.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Great work so far. Let's summarize what we've learned. In this project, we learned about the different types of operators in Python and how they are used, what conditional statements are and how they are structured, and how we can use logical and comparison operators in conditional statements to make decisions in our code!

For this last question, we are going to use what we've been building up this entire project on some real world data and make observations based on our work! The below code has been provided to you, and contains a few new concepts we are going to cover in next week's project (namely, `for` loops and lists). For now, you don't have to understand fully what is going on. Just insert the conditions you wrote in the last problem where specified to complete the code (you only have to change lines with `===` in comments), run it, and write at least 2 sentences about the results of running your code and any observations you may have regarding that output. Include in those two sentences what percentage of the Olympics were held on leap years. (If you are interested in understanding the provided code, feel free to take some time to read the comments explaining what each line is doing.)

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Olympics data can be found at "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv"
====

[NOTE]
====
In the below code, you may have noticed the addition of `.unique()` when we're getting a list of years from our data. We'll refrain from covering this in detail until a future project, but what you can know is that here it takes our list of all years and removes all the duplicate years so we have only one of each year in our resulting `year_list`
====

[source, Python]
----
import pandas as pd

olympics_df = # === read the dataset in here ===

# get a list of each year in our olympics_df, 
#   and then use .unique() to remove duplicate years
year_list = olympics_df["Year"].unique()

# create an empty list for our results
leap_list = [] 

# apply our conditional to each year in our list of years
for year in year_list:
    if # === add your condition for leap years here ===
        # add the year to our list of leap years 
        leap_list.append(year)
    else:
        # if its not a leap year, do nothing
        pass

# prints our list of leap years and number of leap years
print("The Olympics were held on leap years in:", sorted(leap_list))
print(len(leap_list), "of the", len(year_list), "Olympics occurrences in our data were held on a leap year.")
----

.Deliverables
====
- The results of running the completed code
- At least two sentences with observations about the results and what percent of Olympics are held on leap years
====

== Submitting your Work

Great job, you've completed Project 2! This project was your first real foray into the world of Python, and it is okay to feel a bit overwhelmed (I know I was at first!). Python is likely a new language to you, and just like any other language, it will get much easier with time and practice. As we keep building on these fundamental concepts in the next few weeks, don't be afraid to come back and revisit your previous work or re-read sections of project instructions. As always, please ask any questions you have during seminar, on Piazza, or in office hours. We hope you have a great rest of your week, and we're excited to keep learning about Python with you in the next project!
