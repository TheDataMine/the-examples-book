== Questions
[NOTE]
====
- Review section of  Flexibility vs. Interpretability
====
=== Question 1: Please contrast flexibility and interpretability in modeling techniques (1 point).



- Answer


Flexible models, such as neural networks, can handle complex data but are often difficult to interpret, making them "black boxes." Interpretable models, like linear regression, are simpler to understand but may not capture complex patterns effectively.

== Question 2: Please using a code example of a flexible model and an interpretable model to show the different steps ,assume that the training data X_train and y_train are already prepared (1 point)

 

-  Answer
[source,python]
----
# Flexible Model: Neural Network using Keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=10)

# Interpretable Model: Decision Tree using scikit-learn
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

Review Classification vs. Regression
====


==  Question 3: Please contrast classification problems from regression problems (1 point)


- Answer  
    

Classification problems predict categorical outcomes
regression problems predict continuous outcomes.

== Question 4: Please using a code example to show steps to create a classification model and a regression model, assume that the training data X_train and y_train are already prepared (1 point).

- Answer Goes Here
[source,python]
----
# Classification: Logistic Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Regression: Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
----

====
Review Prediction vs. Inference
====
== Question 5: Please explain the scenarios to use prediction versus inference (1 point)

- Answer  

Predict if for accurate predictions
Inference if for understanding the relationships

== Question 6: Please use a code example to show just the steps to create a model for prediction and one for inference, assume that the training data X_train and y_train are already prepared( 1 point).

- Answer  

[source,python]
----
# Prediction: Random Forest
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Inference: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression using statsmodels
import statsmodels.api as sm

X_train = sm.add_constant(X_train)
ols = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train)
results = ols.fit()

print(results.summary())

[NOTE]
====
Review Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
====
== Question 7: Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning (1 point).

- Answer  

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover patterns or structures.

== Question 8: Provide an example of a supervised learning model and an unsupervised learning model, assume that the training data X_train and y_train are already prepared (1 point).

=== Answer  
[source,python]
----
# Supervised Learning: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
from sklearn.svm import SVC

clf = SVC()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
----
[source,python]
----
# Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X_train)

labels = kmeans.predict(X_train)
----

[NOTE]
====
Review Non-parameterization with Splines
====

==  Question 9: Please explain what is splines(1 point)

Answer  

Splines definition:  

== Question 10: Please use a code example to show the steps to create a spline (1 point)

Answer  
[source,python]
----
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline

# Create Sample data points
x = # Your Code here
y = # Your Code here

# Create a spline
spline = # Your Code here
