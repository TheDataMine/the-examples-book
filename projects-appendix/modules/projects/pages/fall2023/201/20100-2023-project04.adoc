= TDM 20100: Project 4 -- 2023


**Motivation:** Becoming comfortable piping commands in a chain, and getting used to navigating files in a terminal, are important skills for every data scientist to learn. These skills will give you the ability to quickly understand and manipulate files in a way which is not possible using tools like Microsoft Office, Google Sheets, etc. You may find that these UNIX tools are really useful for analyzing data.

**Context:** We've been using UNIX tools in a terminal to solve a variety of problems. In this project we will continue to solve problems by combining a variety of tools using a form of redirection called 'piping'. 

**Scope:** grep, regular expression basics, UNIX utilities, redirection, piping

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use `cut` to section off and slice up data from the command line.
- Use `|` piping to string UNIX commands together.
- Use `sort` and it's options to sort data in different ways.
- Use `head` to isolate n lines of output.
- Use `wc` to summarize the number of lines in a file or in output.
- Use `uniq` to filter out non-unique lines.
- Use `grep` to search files effectively.
****

[NOTE]
====
The following statement will check how many columns are found in this csv file:

[source,bash]
cat /anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/2011.csv | tr ',' '\n' | wc -l

BUT this file is a little bit strange, because it only has 1 large line.  (In fact, there is no line ending at the end of the line, so `wc` says that the file has 0 lines!)

[source,bash]
wc /anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/2011.csv

In the question below, we can to turn the commas in this file into newline characters, and then count the number of words in the file.

* In a csv file, the number of columns is usually 1 larger than the number of commas. 
* `cat` prints the file
* `head -n10` prints the first 10 lines of the file
* `tr ',' '\n'` replaces all commas with the newline character `\n` 
* `wc` counts the number of lines, words, and characters.  
====

[upperalpha]
.. Please use commands `head`, `tr` and `wc` to find out how many words occur in the first 10 lines of the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/unprocessed/2011.csv`

[NOTE]
====
As you can see, csv files are not always so straightforward to parse. For this particular set of questions, we want to focus on using some other UNIX tools that are more useful on semi-clean datasets, e.g. `awk` 

The following statement outputs the number of columns in each of the first 10 lines of the file:
[source, bash]
head /anvil/projects/tdm/data/stackoverflow/processed/2011.csv | awk -F";" '{print NF}'

* `awk` can be used for simple data manipulation tasks that involve pattern matching, field extraction, arithmetic, and string operations 

    ** -F";": Set the field separator to ;.
    ** {print NF}: Print the number of fields in each line.

We are just starting to introduce `awk`, a little utility that allows us to analyze each line of the data.  The main part of an awk command runs once on each line of the data set.

====
[upperalpha]

.. Let's turn our attention to a different file.  Use `awk` to find out how many columns appear in the fifth row of the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt`

[NOTE]
====
With appropriate commands, the following statement use finds the 5 largest orders, in terms of the number of `Bottles Sold`
[source, bash]
cat /anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt | cut -d';' -f21 | sort -nr | head -n 5

* `cat` is used to display the entire content of the file
* `cut` is an UNIX command used to remove or "cut out" certain sections of each line from a file or the output of a command.
** -d ';' specifies that the delimiter (or separator) between fields is the semicolon (;).
** -f21 tells cut to only retrieve the 21st field/column (`Bottles Sold` column) based on the semicolon delimiter. So, after this command, you'll get only the `Bottles Sold` values from the 21st column of the file `iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt`.
* `sort` arranges lines of text alphabetically or numerically.
** -n means "numeric sort", so the values are treated as numbers and not as strings.
** -r means "reverse", so the output will be in descending order
* `head` is used to display only first 5 lines 

====
[upperalpha]
.. Use UNIX commands to find out what are the 6 highest 'state bottle retail' prices from the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt` and what are the analogous item descriptions for these 6 items?  (Some are repeated, and that is OK.)

[TIP]
====
* column 16 is for 'item description' and column 20 is for 'state bottle retail' price

[NOTE]

Here is another example. We can pipeline `cat`, `cut`,`sort` and `uniq` to display how many times each unique bottle volume appears in the file
[source,bash]
cat /anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt | cut -d';' -f18 | sort -n | uniq -c

* column 18 (-f18) is for 'Bottle Volume (ml)'
* `uniq` with the `-c` option, finds the number of occurrences of each outcome
====
[upperalpha]

.. Please find out how many times each bottle volume appears in the file

[TIP]
====
* column 18 indicates the bottle volume
