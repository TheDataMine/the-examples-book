= TDM 40100: Project 12 -- 2022

**Motivation:** In general, scraping data from websites has always been a popular topic in The Data Mine. In addition, it was one of the requested topics. For the remaining projects, we will be doing some scraping of housing data, and potentially: `sqlite3`, containerization, and analysis work as well.

**Context:** This is the third in a series of 4 projects with a focus on web scraping that incorporates of variety of skills we've touched on in previous data mine courses. For this second project, we continue to build our suite of tools designed to scrape public housing data. 

**Scope:** playwright, Python, web scraping 

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use playwright to interact with a web page prior to scraping.
- Use playwright and xpath expressions to efficiently scrape targeted data.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Questions

=== Question 1

This has been (maybe) a bit intense for a project series. This project is going to give you a little break and not give you _anything_ new to do, except changing the package we are using.

`playwright` is a modern web scraping tool backed by Microsoft, that, like `selenium`, allows you to interact with a web page before scraping. `playwright` is not necessarily better (yet), however, it _is_ different, and actively maintained.

Implement the `get_links`, and `link_to_blob` functions using `playwright` instead of `selenium`. You can find the documentation for `playwright` xref:https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro[here].

Before you get started, you will need to run the following in a `bash` cell.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

python3 -m playwright install
----

Finally, we aren't going to force you to fight with the `playwright` documentation to get started, so the following is an example of code that will run in a Jupyter notebook, _and_ perform many of the basic/same operations you are acustomed to with `selenium`.

[source,python]
----
import time
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

# so we can run this from within Jupyter, which is already async
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.firefox.launch(headless=True)
        context = await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://purdue.edu/directory")
        
        # print the page source
        print(await page.content())
        
        # get html element
        e = page.locator("xpath=//html")

        # print the inner html of the element
        print(await e.inner_html())
        
        # isolate the search bar "input" element
        inp = e.locator("xpath=.//input")
        
        # print the outer html, or the element and contents
        print(await inp.evaluate("el => el.outerHTML"))

        # fill the input with "mdw"
        await inp.fill("mdw")
        print(await inp.evaluate("el => el.outerHTML"))
        
        # find the search button and click it
        await page.locator("xpath=//a[@id='glass']").click()
        
        # We can delay the program to allow the page to load
        time.sleep(5)

        # find the table in the page with dr. wards content
        table = page.locator("xpath=//table[@class='more']")
        
        # print the table and contents
        print(await table.evaluate("el => el.outerHTML"))
        
        # find the alias, if a selector starts with // or .. it is assumed to be xpath
        print(await page.locator("//th[@class='icon-key']").evaluate("el => el.outerHTML"))
        
        # you can print an attribute
        print(await page.locator("//th[@class='icon-key']").get_attribute("scope"))
        
        # similarly, you can print an elements content
        print(await page.locator("//th[@class='icon-key']").inner_text())
        
        # you could use the regular xpath stuff, no problem
        print(await page.locator("//th[@class='icon-key']/following-sibling::td").inner_text())
        
        await browser.close()

=== Question 2

Implement the `get_links` function using `playwright`. Test it out so the exmaple below is the same (or close, listed houses may change).

[TIP]
====
Here is the `selenium` version.

[source,python]
----
def get_links(search_term: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Given a search term, return a list of web links for all of the resulting properties.
    """
    def _load_cards(driver):
        """
        Given the driver, scroll through the cards
        so that they all load.
        """
        cards = driver.find_elements("xpath", "//article[starts-with(@id, 'zpid')]")
        while True:
            try:
                num_cards = len(cards)
                driver.execute_script('arguments[0].scrollIntoView();', cards[num_cards-1])
                time.sleep(2)
                cards = driver.find_elements("xpath", "//article[starts-with(@id, 'zpid')]")
                if num_cards == len(cards):
                    break
                num_cards = len(cards)
            except StaleElementReferenceException:
                # every once in a while we will get a StaleElementReferenceException
                # because we are trying to access or scroll to an element that has changed.
                # this probably means we can skip it because the data has already loaded.
                continue
                
    links = []
    url = f"https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/{'-'.join(search_term.split(' '))}_rb/"
    
    firefox_options = Options()
    # Headless mode means no GUI
    firefox_options.add_argument("--headless")
    firefox_options.add_argument("--disable-extensions")
    firefox_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    firefox_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=firefox_options)
    
    with driver as d:
        d.get(url)
        d.delete_all_cookies()
        while True:
            time.sleep(2)
            _load_cards(d)
            links.extend([e.get_attribute("href") for e in d.find_elements("xpath", "//a[@data-test='property-card-link' and @class='property-card-link']")])
            next_link = d.find_element("xpath", "//a[@rel='next']")
            if next_link.get_attribute("disabled") == "true":
                break
            url = next_link.get_attribute('href')
            d.delete_all_cookies()
            next_link.click()
                                                            
    return links

[TIP]
====
Use the `set_viewport_size` function to change the browser's width to 960 and height to 1080.
====

[TIP]
====
Don't forget to `await` the async functions -- this is going to be the most likely source of errors.
====

[TIP]
====
Unlike in `selenium`, in `playwright`, you won't be able to do something like this:

[source,python]
----
# wrong
cards = page.locator("xpath=//article[starts-with(@id, 'zpid')]")
len(cards) # get the number of cards found
----

Instead, you'll have to use the useful https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-count[`count`] function to get the nth element in the list of cards.

[source,python]
----
cards = page.locator("xpath=//article[starts-with(@id, 'zpid')]")
num_cards = await cards.count()
----
====

[TIP]
====
Unlike in `selenium`, in `playwright`, you won't be able to do something like this:

[source,python]
----
# wrong
cards = page.locator("xpath=//article[starts-with(@id, 'zpid')]")
await cards[num_cards-1].scroll_into_view_if_needed()
----

Instead, you'll have to use the useful https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-nth[`nth`] function to get the nth element in the list of cards.

[source,python]
----
cards = page.locator("xpath=//article[starts-with(@id, 'zpid')]")
await cards.nth(num_cards-1).scroll_into_view_if_needed()

[TIP]
====
To clear cookies, search for "cookie" in the playwright documentation. Hint: you can clear cookies using the context object.

This following provides a working skeleton to run the asynchronous code in Jupyter.

=== Question 3

Implement the `link_to_blob` function using `playwright`. Test it out so the example below functions.

Test out a `playwright` feature from the https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro[documentation] that is new to you. This could be anything. One suggestion that could be interesting would be screenshots. As long as you demonstrate _something_ new, you will receive credit for this question. Have fun, and happy thanksgiving!
