= TDM 10200: Project 1 -- 2023

**Motivation:** In this project we are going to jump head first into The Data Mine. We will load datasets into  environment, and introduce some core programming concepts like variables, vectors, types, etc. As we will be "living" primarily in an IDE called Jupyter Lab, we will take some time to learn how to connect to it, configure it, and run code.

**Context:** This is our first project this spring semester. We will get situated, configure the environment we will be using throughout our time with The Data Mine, and jump straight into working with data!

**Scope:** Python, Jupyter Lab, Anvil

.Learning Objectives
****
- Learn how to run Python code in Jupyter Lab on Anvil.
- Read and write basic (csv) data using Python.

Navigate and login to https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu using your ACCESS credentials (and Duo). You will be met with a screen, with lots of options. Don't worry, however, the next steps are very straightforward.

[TIP]
====
If you did not (yet) setup your 2-factor authentication credentials with Duo, you can go back to Step 9 and setup the credentials here: https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/data-engineering//rcac/access-setup
====

Towards the middle of the top menu, there will be an item labeled btn:[My Interactive Sessions], click on btn:[My Interactive Sessions]. On the left-hand side of the screen you will be presented with a new menu. You will see that there are a few different sections: Bioinformatics, Interactive Apps, and The Data Mine. Under "The Data Mine" section, you should see a button that says btn:[Jupyter Notebook], click on btn:[Jupyter Notebook].

If everything was successful, you should see a screen similar to the following.

image::figure01.webp[OnDemand Jupyter Lab, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="OnDemand Jupyter Lab"]

Make sure that your selection matches the selection in **Figure 1**. Once satisfied, click on btn:[Launch]. Behind the scenes, OnDemand launches a job to run Jupyter Lab. This job has access to 2 CPU cores and 3800 Mb. 

[NOTE]
====
If you select 4000 Mb of memory instead of 3800 Mb, you will end up getting 3 CPU cores instead of 2. OnDemand tries to balance the memory to CPU ratio to be _about_ 1900 Mb per CPU core.
====

We use the Anvil cluster because it provides a consistent, powerful environment for all of our students, and it enables us to easily share massive data sets with the entire Data Mine.

After a few seconds, your screen will update and a new button will appear labeled btn:[Connect to Jupyter]. Click on btn:[Connect to Jupyter] to launch your Jupyter Lab instance. Upon a successful launch, you will be presented with a screen with a variety of kernel options. It will look similar to the following.

image::figure02.webp[Kernel options, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Kernel options"]

There are 2 primary options that you will need to know about.

f2022-s2023::
The course kernel where Python code is run without any extra work, and you have the ability to run R code or SQL queries in the same environment.

[TIP]
====
To learn more about how to run R code or SQL queries using this kernel, see https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/templates[our template page].
====

Let's focus on the f2022-s2023 kernel. Click on btn:[f2022-s2023], and a fresh notebook will be created for you. 

Each line in the Jyupter Notebook is called a `cell`. There are two primary types of cells; code, and markdown. By default the cell will be a a code cell. A markdown cell displays text that that can be formatted using https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-studio-local/1.2.3?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet[markdown language] and will not be treated as code.  You can read more about markdown https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[here].

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
using a *#* before writing in a code cell is a comment. A comment can be documentation of the code that will follow in the cell below. Documentation is important so that others can determine and understand your code.
To add comments you can use the *#* tag . Comments are not run as code so they don't influence the result and are ignored when you run the cell. 
====

In the first cell,  create a markdown cell that has your name and the course number. inside the second cell comment out "Print the sum of 7 and 10", then place the Python code on the next line and run the cell. What is the output?

[source,python]
----
print(7+10)

====
To run the code in a code cell, you can either press kbd:[Ctrl+Enter] on your keyboard or click the small "Play" button in the notebook menu.

In the upper right-hand corner of your notebook, you will see the current kernel for the notebook, `f2022-s2023`. If you click on this name you will have the option to swap kernels out -- no need to do this yet, but it is good to know!

.There are different data types in Python, some of the built in types include: 
* Integer (int)
* Float (float)
* string (str)
* types can include list, tuple, range
* Mapping data type (dict)
* Boolean type (bool)

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
Numeric

. int - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
. long- holds long integers(exists in Python 2.x, deprecated in Python 3.x).
. float- holds floating precision numbers and it is accurate up to 15 decimal places.
. complex- holds complex numbers.

String - a sequence of characters, generally strings are represented by single or double-quotes

Lists- ordered sequence of data written using square brackets *[]* and commas *(,)*. 

Tuple- similar to a list but immutable. Data is written using a parenthesis *()* and commas *(,)*. 

Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair(two pieces of data that have a set of associated values, two related data elements). 
====
We are going to create a variable, we are assigning the numbers 1,2,3 to a variable called my_list. 

[source,python]
----
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(f'My list is: {my_list}')
----

We are going to practice assigning variable and doing some simple requests in Python

.One
.. create a variable named `x` and assign the number 6 to it 
.. create a variable named `y` and assign the number 8 to it 
.. create a variable named `z` and assign `x * y` to it 
.. now print `z`

.Two
.. assign `x,z,y` the same value of "peanutbutter" all in one line

.Three
.. assign the ingredients of a club sandwich to the variable `club_sandwich`

This year, the first step to starting any project should be to download and/or copy https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/_attachments/project_template.ipynb[our project template] (which can also be found on Anvil at `/anvil/projects/tdm/etc/project_template.ipynb`). 

Open the project template and save it into your home directory, in a new notebook named `firstname-lastname-project01.ipynb`. 

Fill out the project template, replacing the default text with your own information, and transferring all work you've done up until this point into your new notebook. If a category is not applicable to you (for example, if you did _not_ work on this project with someone else), put N/A.

Let's pretend we are now done with the project. We've written some code, maybe added some markdown cells to explain what we did, and we are ready to submit our assignment. For this course, we will turn in a variety of files, depending on the project.

We will always require a Jupyter Notebook file. Jupyter Notebook files end in `.ipynb`. This is our "source of truth" and what the graders will turn to first when grading. 

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output, when in fact it does not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or it does not render properly in gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
====

A `.ipynb` file is generated by first running every cell in the notebook, and then clicking the "Download" button from menu:File[Download].

In addition to the `.ipynb`, if a project uses Python code., you will need to also submit a Python script. A Python script is just a text file with the extension `.py`.

Let's practice.  take the Python code from this project and copy and paste it into a text file with the `.py` extension. Call it `firstname-lastname-project01.py`. Download your `.ipynb` file -- making sure that the output from all of your code is present and in the notebook (the `.ipynb` file will also be referred to as "your notebook" or "Jupyter notebook").

Once complete, submit your notebook,and Python script.

.Items to submit
====
- `firstname-lastname-project01.py`.
- `firstname-lastname-project01.ipynb`.
====

[WARNING]
====
_Please_ make sure to double check that your submission is complete, and contains all of your code and output before submitting. If you are on a spotty internet connection, it is recommended to download your submission after submitting it to make sure what you _think_ you submitted, was what you _actually_ submitted.
