== Loading the database

[source,sql]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

== Extracting a few rows from the each of the 6 tables

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM episodes LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM ratings LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM crew LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM akas LIMIT 5;
----

== We can ask for more than 5 rows too.  For instance, here we ask for 15 rows instead of 5 rows.

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 15;
----

== We can see how many rows were in each table, as follows:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titles LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM episodes LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people LIMIT 5;
----

== We can also start to investigate individual people, for instance:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = 'Ryan Reynolds' LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = 'Hayden Christensen' LIMIT 5;
----

== Say Anything is one of Dr Ward's favorite movies.  We can find it here:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE title_id = 'tt0098258' LIMIT 5;
----

== Friends is one of Dr Ward's favorite shows.  We can find it here:

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE (primary_title = 'Friends') AND (premiered > 1992) LIMIT 5;
----

== We can investigate how many titles premiered in each year, by grouping things together according to the year that the title premiered, and by ordering the results according to the year that the title premiered.  The "desc" specifies that we want the results in descending order, i.e., with the largest result first (where "largest" means the "last year", because we are ordering by the years).

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*), premiered FROM titles
GROUP BY premiered ORDER BY premiered DESC LIMIT 20;
----

== The Family Guy premiered in 1999 and ended in 2022.

[source,sql]

----

== There were 8107 people from IMDB born in 1976:
[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people WHERE born = 1976 LIMIT 5;
----

== We can get the number of people born in every year from 1976 onwards:
[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*), born FROM people WHERE born >= 1976 GROUP BY born LIMIT 5;
----

== Here are some tvSeries that premiered since the year 2000:
[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT * FROM titles WHERE (premiered >= 2000) AND (type = 'tvSeries') LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
%%sql

GROUP BY born LIMIT 200;
----

[source,sql]

%%sql
SELECT * FROM crew WHERE person_id = 'nm0000184' LIMIT 5;
