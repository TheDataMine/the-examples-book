= STAT 39000: Project 6 -- Spring 2021

**Motivation:** Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is a skill that is invaluable in _many_ fields. It can be pretty fun too! In this project, you can pick and choose if a couple of different plotting projects.

**Context:** We've been working hard all semester, learning a lot about web scraping. In this project, you are given the choice between a project designed to go through some `matplotlib` basics, and a project that has you replicate plots from a book using `plotly` (an interactive plotting package) inside a Jupyter Notebook (which you would submit instead of an RMarkdown file).

**Scope:** python, visualizing data

.Learning objectives
****
- Demostrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
- Demonstrate the ability to customize a plot (color, shape/linetype).

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Option 1

xref:29000-s2021-project06.adoc[Our 29000 project (that may be too familiar to you by now)]

== Option 2

https://github.com/oscarperpinan/bookvis/tree/master/figs[Here] are a variety of interesting graphics from the popular book https://oscarperpinan.github.io/spacetime-vis/[Displaying time series, spatial and space-time data with R] by Oscar Perpinan Lamigueiro. You can replicate the graphics using data found https://github.com/oscarperpinan/bookvis/tree/master/data[here]. 

Choose 3 graphics from the book to replicate using `plotly`. The replications do not need to be perfect -- a strong effort to get as close as possible is fine. Feel free to change colors as you please. If you have the desire to improve the graphic, please feel free to do so and explain how it is an improvement. 

Use https://notebook.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu and the f2020-s2021 kernel to complete this project. The _only_ thing you need to submit for this project is the downloaded .ipynb file. Make sure that the grader will be able to click "run all" (using the same kernel, f2020-s2021), and have everything run properly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The object of this project is to challenge yourself (as much as you want), learn about and mess around with `plotly`, and be creative. If you have an idea for a cool plot, graphic, or modification, please include it!
