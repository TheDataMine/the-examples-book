= TDM 20200: Project 6 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is a skill that is invaluable in many fields. It can be pretty fun too! In this project, we are going to dive into plotting using `plotly`, a very popular open source graphing library that can interact graphs online.

**Context:** Create good visualizations about housing data using `plotly`. In the next project, we will continue to learn about and become comfortable using `plotly`.

**Scope:** Python, visualizations, plotly

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
- Demonstrate the ability to customize a plot (color, shape/linetype). 
****
 

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/zillow/Metro_time_series.csv`


== Readings and Resources

[NOTE]
====
- Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].
- You may refer to https://plot.ly/python[plot introduction]
- Read about the plotly express functions on https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/[this] page.

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
Dr Ward created 4 videos to help with this project.

====

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Read in the data and called it `myDF`.
.. Update the column `Date` to the `datetime` data type.
.. For each `Date`, sum the values in the column `InventoryRaw_AllHomes`.
.. Now plot a line chart that shows the overall housing inventory (i.e., the results from question 1c), for the date in the years 2010 through 2015.


[TIP]
====
- You might choose to use `to_datetime()` to convert the data type in part b.
====

[WARNING]
====
Some students turned in the previous project without executing their code in their Jupyter Lab notebook!  Please remember that you need to run all of your cells before submitting your Jupyter Lab notebook.
====


=== Question 2 (2 points)

For this question, `United_States` is one of the regions, but we want you to ignore that region in this question.

.. Using the column `InventoryRaw_AllHomes`, group the data according to the `RegionName`, and find the `mean` of this column for each `RegionName`.
.. Similar question:  Using the column `AgeOfInventory`, group the data according to the `RegionName`, and find the `mean` of this column for each `RegionName`.
.. Now make a bar chart from your results in part 2a, to visualize the top 5 regions with the highest inventory of homes (on average, in those regions). 
.. Similarly, use the results from 2b, to make a bar chart to visualize the top 5 regions with the oldest inventory of homes (on average, in those regions).

[TIP]
====
- `groupby()` and `mean()` are useful to get the average values
- `sort_values()` is useful to sort data in order
====
 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Convert your work from question 2d into a box plot, so that you can visualize the top 5 regions with the oldest inventory of homes.

[TIP]
====
- You may refer to the box plot session in the https://plot.ly/python[plot introduction]
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Extract the data from the columns `Date` and `ZHVI_SingleFamilyResidence`, for the `RegionName` 28580.
.. Use this data to demonstrate how the Zillow Home Value Index for Single Family Homes has fluctuated in the `RegionName` 28580 during the available time period in the data set.

[TIP]
====
- Be certain to document your work, i.e., how did you make the plot, and what did you learn from the plot?
====


=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Now make a data visualization of your own, using the data set.  Be sure to explain why you decided to choose the data that you analyzed from this data set, and be sure to explain your reasoning.  Also be sure to explain the type of visualization method that you chose.  Your work should be well documented throughout this question.

[WARNING]
====
Just (gently) repeating the earlier warning:  Some students turned in the previous project without executing their code in their Jupyter Lab notebook!  Please remember that you need to run all of your cells before submitting your Jupyter Lab notebook.
