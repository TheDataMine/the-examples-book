= TDM 20200: Project 13 -- Spring 2024

**Motivation:** In project 12 we created a container by pulling the `ubuntu` image. In this project we will try to create one simple container with a Virtual machine (as a simple web application).

**Context:** Create simple conceptual web app using `Flask` and create a container for the web app 

**Scope:** Python, Visual Studio Code, container, flask

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a conceptual web application using flask on Anvil 
- Create a container for the web app
- Develop skills and techniques to create a `container`
- Understand the `Flask` framework
****

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
..  Start a QEMU virtual machine and connect to it via `ssh`.
+
[TIP]
====
- You may refer back to Project 12, where we learned the steps needed to start a virtual machine and connect to it.
====

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Use the statement `docker pull python:3.10-slim` to pull a Python image from Docker Hub.  (You do not need to run the docker image yet; just pull it for now.)
.. Create a new directory named `flaskP13App`.  Inside that directory, using an editor (such `nano` or `vim`), create a simple file called `helloWorld.py` which we will later use to display a sentence in a webpage.  The sentence may be simple, e.g., "Hello from Flask inside a Docker container!"  
+
[HINT]
====
- This https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/[flask tutorial] should be helpful, for students who want to know more about making a Flask app.  For our purposes, our `helloWorld.py` file can be as simple as the following:
[source, makefile]
----
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello from Flask inside a Docker container!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8050, debug=True)

----
====
+
[WARNING]
====
Make SURE that your indentations look correct in your file!
====
+
.. Create a `requirements.txt` file; it is a list of packages or libraries needed to work on a project. For instance, your `requirements.txt` might look like this:
+
[source, makefile]
----
flask==2.1.1
jinja2==3.0.2
werkzeug==2.0.1

----

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Create a file called `Dockerfile` inside the `flaskP13App` directory.
If you want a full introduction to Docker, you can read this https://docker-curriculum.com/[docker introduction], but for our purposes, the file called `Dockerfile` can just look like this:

----
# example of the contents of a dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /home/tdm

# Copy all of the files from the current directory into the Docker container
COPY . .

# Install the packages from the requirements file
RUN pip install -r /home/tdm/requirements.txt

# Install Flask
RUN pip install Flask

# Make port 8050 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8050

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run helloWorld.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "helloWorld.py"]

----


 
=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Build the Docker image using the command
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t flaskapp .
----

(Don't forget the period at the end of the command!  The period refers to the current directory.)

There will be a couple of WARNING sentences written in red, but do not worry!

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Run the Flask App in a Docker Container using the command
[source,bash]
----
docker run flaskapp
----

For the output from this question, you may choose to just take a screen shot of your terminal output, showing that everything is running successfully, for instance, like this:

.output
----
localhost:~/flaskP13App% docker run flaskapp
