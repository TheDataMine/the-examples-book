= TDM 20200: Project 8 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Spark uses a distributed computing model to process data, which means that data is processed in parallel across a cluster of machines. PySpark is a Spark API that allows you to interact with Spark through the Python shell, or in Jupyter Lab, or in DataBricks, etc. PySpark provides a way to access Spark's framework using Python. It combines the simplicity of Python with the power of Apache Spark.

**Context:** Understand components of Spark's ecosystem that PySpark can use

**Scope:** Python, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLib, GraphX

.Learning Objectives
****
- Develop skills and techniques to use PySpark to read a dataset, perform transformations like filtering, mapping and execute actions like count, collect 
- Understand how to use PySpark SQL to run SQL queries
****

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/weather.parquet`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

.. Run the example from https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/data-engineering/containers/pyspark[Example book - PySpark], in Pandas and then in Spark.  Make sure to show the time used by each of these methods.

.. Comment on the different speeds needed, to process data using Pandas vs PySpark.
 

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Run the following code to initiating a PySpark application.  The name of our PySpark session is `sp` but you may use a different name.  This is the entry point to using Spark's functionality with a DataFrame and with the SQL API.
.. Read the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/weather.parquet` into a PySpark DataFrame called `myDF`
.. Show the first 5 rows of the resulting PySpark DataFrame.

[source,python]
----
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
sp = SparkSession.builder.appName('TDM_S').config("spark.driver.memory", "2g").getOrCreate()
----

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. List the DataFrame's column names and data types
.. How many rows are in the DataFrame?
.. How many unique `station_id` values are in the data set?

[TIP]
====
- The `printSchema()` function is useful to explore a DataFrame's structure.
-  You may use the `select()` function to select the column, and you can use the `distinct()` and `count()` functions to get the distinct values.
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)
.. Create a Temporary View called `weather` from the PySpark DataFrame `myDF`.
.. Run a SQL Query to get the total number of records for each station.
.. Run a SQL Query to get the maximum wind speed recorded by each station.
.. Run a SQL Query to the average temperature recorded by each station.

[TIP]
====
- `createOrReplaceTempView()` is useful for part 4a.
====

[TIP]
====
- You may refer to `sp.sql()`
- Use `GROUP BY station_id` to group together the data from each `station_id` before performing the Spark SQL query.
====

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Explore the DataFrame, and run 2 SQL Queries of your own choosing.  Explain the meaning of your two queries and what you learn from the queries.
