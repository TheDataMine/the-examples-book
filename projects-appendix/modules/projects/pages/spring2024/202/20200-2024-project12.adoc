= TDM 20200: Project 12 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Containers are everywhere and a very popular method of packaging an application with all of the requisite dependencies. This project we will learn some basics of containerization in a virtual environment using Alpine Linux. We first will start a virtual machine on Anvil, then create a simple container in the virtual machine. You may find more information about container and relationship between virtual machine and container here: https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container

**Context:** The project is to provide very foundational knowledge about containers and virtualization, focusing on theoretical understanding and basic system interactions. 

**Scope:** Python, containers, UNIX

.Learning Objectives
****
- Improve your mental model of what a container is and why it is useful.
- Use UNIX tools to effectively create a container.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]

.. Logon to Anvil and use a bash command to find an available port you may use later 
 
[TIP]
==== 
Example code, you may modify or create your own code if needed
[source, bash]
----
 
#! /bin/bash

for port in {1025..65535}; do
    python3 -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM); result=s.connect_ex(('127.0.0.1', $port)); s.close(); exit(result)"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "port $port open"
        break
    fi
done

----
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

.. Launch a virtual machine (VM) on Anvil.  (Note that Docker is already pre-installed on Anvil.) Submit the output showing the job id and process id, after you start a virtual machine; it should look like this, for example:

[source,bash]
----
.output
[1] 3152048
----

[NOTE]
====
The most popular containerization tool at the time of writing is likely Docker. We will Launch a virtual machine on Anvil (which already has Docker pre-installed).

Open up a terminal on Anvil. You may do it from within Jupyter Lab. Run the following code, to ensure that the SLURM environment variables don't alter or effect our SLURM job.

[source,bash]
----
for i in $(env | awk -F= '/SLURM/ {print $1}'); do unset $i; done;
----

Next, let's make a copy of a pre-made operating system image. This image has Alpine Linux and a few basic tools installed, including: nano, vim, emacs, and Docker. 

[source,bash]
----
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/apps/qemu/images/builder.qcow2 $SCRATCH
----

Next, we need to make `qemu` available to our shell. Open a terminal and run the following code

[source,bash]
----
module load qemu
# check the module loaded
module list
----

Next, let's launch our virtual machine with about 8GB of memory and 4 cores. Replace the "1025" with the port number that you got from question 1.

[source,bash]
----
qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc none,ipv4=on -hda $SCRATCH/builder.qcow2 -m 8G -smp 4 -enable-kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::1025-:22 &

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
- `1025` is an example port number; this needs to be replaced with your port number!
====

Next, it is time to connect to our virtual machine. We will use `ssh` to do this.

[source,bash]
----
ssh -p 1025 tdm@localhost -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
----

If the command fails, try waiting a minute and rerunning the command -- it may take a minute for the virtual machine to boot up.

When prompted for a password, enter `purdue`. Your username is `tdm` and password is `purdue`.

Finally, now that you have a shell in your virtual machine, you can do anything you want! You have superuser permissions within your virtual machine! 
For this question, submit a screenshot showing the output of `hostname` from within your virtual machine!

====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

.. Use `df -h` to check the disk space.
.. Use `printenv` to get the user's environment variables.  Choose 2 of those environment variables and explain their meanings.
.. Use `ls` to list the files in the current directory
+
[TIP]
====
- You may refer to the following sample code (or create your own approach)
- If `ls` does not return anything, use `ls -la`
[source, bash] 
----
df -h
printenv
ls 
----
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)
.. Write and execute a shell script that calculates the number of files in the current directory and displays the result in a formatted message.

[TIP]
====
[source, bash]
----
echo 'echo "There are $(ls | wc -l) files in the current directory."' > countFiles.sh
----

- run the shell script

[source, bash]
----
chmod +x countFiles.sh
./countFiles.sh
----
====

 
=== Question 5 (2 pts)

After you complete the previous questions, you can see that you can use the virtual machine just like your own computer. Now use the following steps, to use Docker within the virtual machine to create and manage a container. Run all the commands in your terminal.  Copy the output to your Jupyter Lab cells.

.. List the docker version inside the virtual machine
+
[source, bash]
----
docker --version
----
+
.. Pull the "ubuntu" image from Docker Hub
+
[source, bash]
----
docker pull ubuntu
----
+
..Run a container based on the "ubuntu" image
+
[source, bash]
----
docker run -it ubuntu bash
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When the command runs, docker will create a container from the `ubuntu` image and run it.  
====
+
.. Once inside the container shell, you should see the prompt changed to root@.  Run the following command to install `cowsay`
+
[source,bash]
----
apt-get update && apt-get install -y cowsay
----
+
.. Now find the directory that `cowsay` locates. Go to that directory to run `cowsay` with following command
+
[source,bash]
----
./cowsay "Your greetings here :)"
----
+
.. Use `exit` to leave the container
+
[source,bash]
----
exit
----
+
.. List the container(s) with following command.  It will provide you with a list of all of the containers that are currently running.
+
[source, bash]
----
docker ps -a
----
+
.. After you confirm that the container ran successfully, you may using following command to remove it.
+
[source, bash]
----
docker rm [Container_id]
----
+
[TIP]
====
Replace [Container_id] with the id that you got from previous question.
