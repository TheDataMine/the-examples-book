Unless otherwise specified, all projects will need 2-3 submitted files:

. The `.ipynb` file (based off of the provided template). See xref:submissions.adoc#how-to-download-notebook[here] to learn how to download the `.ipynb` file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Output _must_ be displayed in the `.ipynb` file unless otherwise specified. **Double check** that the output is correct _in Gradescope_. You are responsible for all work submitted in Gradescope. If your submission does not render properly, please contact a TA for help. 

You will be graded on the work and how it is rendered in Gradescope, _not_ how it renders on https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu. Please see xref:submissions.adoc#double-checking-submissions[here] to learn how to properly double check your submission and make sure it renders properly in Gradescope.

+
. If it is a project containing R code, a `.R` file containing all of the R code with comments explaining what the code does. 
. If it is a project containing Python code, a `.py` file containing all of the Python code with comments explaining what the code does.
. If it is a project containing `bash` code, a `.sh` file containing all of the `bash` code with comments explaining what the code does.

== How to download notebook

First make sure you are in Jupyter Lab on https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu. It should look something like the following.

To download your notebook (`.ipynb` file), click on menu:File[Download] and select where you'd like to save the file. Then, when uploading your submission to Gradescope, simply upload the `.ipynb` file you _just_ downloaded.

== Double checking submissions

In order to double check that your submission (namely, your `.ipynb` file) renders properly in Gradescope, first submit your project files in Gradescope. 

[TIP]
====
Don't worry, you can submit as many times as you want. The graders will always see your most recent submission.
====

Once submitted, you should be presented with a screen that looks similar to the following.

image::figure28.webp[Post submit screen, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Post submit screen"]

Click on the button in the upper right-hand corner named "Code". 

image::figure29.webp[Click "Code", width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Click Code"]

You should be presented with the same screen that your grader sees. Look at your notebook carefully to make sure your solutions appear as you intended.

[TIP]
====
When uploading to Gradescope, make sure that you upload your `.ipynb` file for the project, and your `.py` with your Python work, your `.R` file with your R work, and your `.sh` with your `bash` work, all at once.  Gradescope will only remember the most recent upload, so you need to upload all 3 files at one time, i.e., in one batch upload.
