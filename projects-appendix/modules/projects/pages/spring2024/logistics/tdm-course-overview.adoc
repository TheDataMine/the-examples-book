== TDM 101/102

The 100 level courses serve as an introduction to two of the core coding language in analytics, Python and R. Students will learn about the basic implementation of the coding languages as well as how to apply them to core skills in analytics and data science. 

The course serves as a great introduction to coding languages and core data analytics topics.

Potential topics include:

* Introduction to core packages (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, R-Shiny)
* Defining and working with functions
* Processes for data manipulation
* Introduction to data analysis

== TDM 201/202

Building on the coding skills learned in the 100 level courses, the 200 level takes Python and R and discusses how they are used in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. Students will leverage their core coding skills to learn about topics like code optimization, web scraping, and utilizing GPUs. 

This course is great to build experience working in Python and R in a research environment. 

Potential topics include:

* Web scraping
* Data visualization
* Code optimization
* Containerization

== TDM 301/302

TDM 300 allows students to take a deeper dive into a specific type of predictive model. The Data Mine is starting with a deep dive into neural nets, but we plan to build out other modeling topics in the future. 

The 300-level course is a great opportunity for students to spend an extended amount of time taking a deep dive into a specific technique. 

*Experience:* This course assumes that you have a background in Python, R, or both coding languages.

Potential topics include:

* Introduction to neural networks
* Hyperparameter tuning for deep learning
* CNN's and computer vision
* Ethics in neural networks

== TDM 401/402

The Data Mine's highest current course offering, TDM 400 is an extension of the 300-level course with additional questions focused on understanding and applying the technique of focus. 

TDM 400 is an opportunity for advanced students to drive their own research into the application of predictive algorithms.

*Experience:* This course assumes that you have a background in Python, R, or both coding languages.

The current implementation of the 400-level course is a deeper dive of the content in the 300-level course.
