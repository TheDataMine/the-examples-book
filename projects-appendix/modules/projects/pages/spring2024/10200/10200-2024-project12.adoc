== Dataset

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/2014.csv`

[WARNING]
====
You need to use 2 cores for your Jupyter Lab session for Project 11 this week.
====

[TIP]
====
You can use `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` if you want to see all of the columns in a very wide data frame.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. In the previous project, you created a class named `Flight`, which contains attributes for the flight number, origin airport ID, destination airport ID, departure time, arrival time, departure delay, and arrival delay. Now let us use this class as a base class. Create a new subclass called `ScheduledFlight`.  Add 2 more attributes to this new subclass: `CRSDepTime` and `CRSArrTime`.
.. Add a method called `is_ontime()` to the class, which returns a boolean value that indicates if the flight departs on time and arrives on time.

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a DataFrame named `myDF`, to store data from the `2014.csv` data set.  It suffices to import (only) the columns listed below, and to (only) read in the first 100 rows.  Although we provide the `columns_to_read`, please make (and use) a dictionary of `col_types` like we did in Question 1 of Project 10.
.. Load the data from `myDF` into the ScheduledFlight class instances.  (When you are finished, you should have a list of 100 ScheduledFlight instances.)

[source,python]
----
columns_to_read = [
    'DepDelay', 'ArrDelay', 'Flight_Number_Reporting_Airline', 'Distance', 
    'CarrierDelay', 'WeatherDelay', 'CRSDepTime', 'CRSArrTime',
    'DepTime', 'ArrTime', 'Origin',
    'Dest', 'AirTime'
]
----

 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Create an empty dictionary named `ontime_count`.  Then use a for loop to assign values to `ontime_count` from the 100 ScheduledFlight objects.
.. Calculate the total number of flights that were on time, for each destination airport.

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Add a method called `is_delayed()` to the class that indicates if the flight was delayed (either had a departure delay or an arrival delay).
.. Calculate the total number of delayed flights, for each destination airport.


=== Question 5 (2 points) 

.. Create a subclass of your own, with at least one method, and then use the dataset to get some meaningful information that uses this subclass.
