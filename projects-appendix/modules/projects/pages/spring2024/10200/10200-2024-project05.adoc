= TDM 10200: Project 5 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Once we have some data analysis working in Python, we often want to wrap it into a function. Dr Ward usually tests anything that he wrote (usually 5 times), to make sure it works, before wrapping it into a function.  Once we are sure our analysis works, if we wrap it into a function, it can usually be easier to use.


**Context:**  Functions also help us to put our work into bite-size pieces that are easier to understand.  The basic idea is similar to functions from R or from other languages and tools. 

**Scope:** functions

== Datasets

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/{year}.csv`

== Reading and Resources

- Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].
- We strongly encourage you to (please) look at our many examples of https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/writing-functions[Python Functions]
- Dr Ward added 4 additional videos that are https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/writing-functions-page-2[specific to Project 5]

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Write a function called `avg_aggreg_temp` that takes 5 parameters: the `file_location` as a string, the `column_title_list` as a list of column titles, the `start_date` as an integer, the `end_date` as an integer, and the temperature `element_code` as a string, with default value `"TAVG"`.  Your function should output the average `value` for rows with that `element_code`.  For instance, in the default case (where `element_code` is `"TAVG"`), your function should output the average `value` which is the average of the average temperatures (as a decimal number).
.. Run the function for on the data set `2018.csv`, using `start_date` 20180101 and `end_date` 20180115, and with `"TAVG"` as the `element_code`.

[NOTE]
====
- Remember that the NOAA data does not include column titles, so use `column_title_list=["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"]`
- The data set is approximately 2.2 GB.  It is OK to use only 1 core for your Jupyter Lab session, if you set chunksize = 10000 as you read in data.
- Input the `start_date` and the `end_date` as integers in the form `yyyymmdd`
- You will need to include a docstring that clearly explains how the function is defined.

=== Question 2 (2 points)
 
.. Create a function that takes a list of years (or, if you prefer, a list of file locations), as a list of column names, and an `element_code` as input, and returns a dictionary with one entry per year.  In the dictionary, for each year, it should have the year as the key and the average value of the specified `element_code` as the value for that year.
.. Test your function for the `element_code` `"TAVG"` and for the range of four years 1880 to 1883 (inclusive), i.e., `range(1880,1884)`.

[TIP]
====
- You can EITHER use a list of years or a list of file locations for the input, but please explain all of your work, and be sure to provide documentation about how a person uses your function.  Documentation is really important!
- Include column titles `["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"]`
====
 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Modify the function that you created in Question 2, to include an extra parameter for the month.  This function should have the same behavior as in Question 2, but for each year, the function should only use the data from that month of the year.
.. Test your function for the `element_code` `"TAVG"` and for the range of four years 1880 to 1883 (inclusive), i.e., `range(1880,1884)`, and for the month August in each year.

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Create a function that takes a list of years as input, and identifies the year that has the most `qflags` of the type that the user specified.
.. Run the function for years in the range 1880 to 1883, and test it with some various `qflag` values, such as D, G, I, K, L, N, O, S, X.


=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Explore the dataset files from the `noaa` directory, and create a function of your own design, about something that interests you. Make sure to include a docstring that explains the function's definition. 
.. Run your function, and explain the inputs and outputs, so that a user can understand how it works.
