= TDM 10200: Project 13 -- Spring 2024

**Motivation:** Flask is a web application framework. It provides tools, libraries, and technologies to build a web application.

**Context:** Create simple conceptual webpage using `Flask` 

**Scope:** Python, Flask, Visual Studio Code

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a development environment to building a web application on Anvil 
- Develop skills and techniques to create a webpage using `Flask` (and also using `Visual Studio Code`)
****

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], launch VS Code on Anvil
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], including the Initial Configuration of VS Code, and install the Python extension for Visual Studio
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], select the Python interpreter path to `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3`
.. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.  Show the current path for the Python interpreter by typing `which python3` (it should show `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3` for the output).

(You can stop reading when you get to the section on "Debugging Python Code" in the starter guide.)

[TIP]
====
For Question 1a, follow the sections of "How can I launch VS Code on Anvil?" Choose the following options:

    - Allocation: "cis220051"
    - CPU Cores: 1
    - Starting Directory: "Home Directory"

If you get "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder" window pop up, click "Yes, I trust the authors"

====
Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/codeediting[Code Editing in Visual Studio Code] to see how to edit and run code
====

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a python file in Visual Studio Code called `helloWorld.py`, simply to create and display a greeting sentence 
.. Run the file in the terminal using:  `python3 helloWorld.py`


=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. After you setup `Visual Studio Code`, create a simple flask application that only defines a Flask instance; call it `app`.  It should look like this (make sure that you get the indenting correct:
+
[source]
----
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8050, debug=True)
----
+
.. Run the python file


[NOTE]
====
- A popup window will show the message: "Your application running on port 8050 is available...".  Click the "Open in Browser" button to open a browser.
- You might need to change the port (say, to 8051, or 8052, etc., depending on how many other students are trying it at the same time!).
- There will be an error displayed, when you click the "Open in Browser", as discussed in Question 4.
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. You should get a 404 page - "Not Found page" for your Question 3, since you have not (yet) defined a route for the home page. The browser likely will say "The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again." Now update the code to add a route for the home page, as shown in the tip below.
+
[TIP]
====
- Use a decorator for the home ("/") route, followed by a function you would like to run. It is ok if you just output a greeting message like "Hello World!"  This should be added to your file, just before the if statement.

[source,python]
----
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
----
====
+
.. Run the python file

[TIP]
====
If you already ran something in the Python terminal and you want it to stop running, you can click into the terminal and type Control-C.
====

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. You should get your message in a webpage in Question 4. Now let us (separately) add an html file, instead of putting the content for the message inside the python file. Create a folder named `templates`, in the same location where your python file is located, and then create a simple html file named `index.html` in the folder, to hold the greeting message.  (Or you may create a fancy html page, but you do not need to make it fancy!)
.. Update your python file root decorator to render the information to the webpage from `index.html`
+
[TIP]
====
- Flask's function called `render_template` is useful.  You can import it by the following statement
[source,python]
----
from flask import Flask
from flask import render_template
----
and you can change your definition of `hello` like this:
[source,python]
----
def hello(name=None):
    return render_template('index.html', name=name)
----
====
+
.. Run the python file

[TIP]
====
Your `index.html` needs to be inside a `templates` directory, and that `templates` directory needs to be in the same place where your application is saved.  For instance, Dr Ward's file is located here:
`/home/x-mdw/templates/index.html`

For instance, Dr Ward's html page looks like this:

[source]
----
<html>
<head>
The head of my example page.
</head>
<body>
Greetings from Dr Ward and Cookie Monster!
</body>
</html>
