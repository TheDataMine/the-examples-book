= STAT 19000: Project 14 -- Fall 2020

**Motivation:** Functions are the building blocks of more complex programming. It's vital that you understand how to read and write functions. In this project we will incrementally build and improve upon a function designed to recommend a beer. Note that you will not be winning any awards for this recommendation system, it is just for fun!

**Context:** One of the main focuses throughout the semester has been on functions, and for good reason. In this project we will continue to exercise our R skills and build up our recommender function.

**Scope:** r, functions

.Learning objectives
****
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Utilize apply functions in order to solve a data-driven problem.
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.

== Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset found in Scholar:

`/class/datamine/data/beer/`

== Questions

=== Question 1

Read `/class/datamine/data/beer/beers.csv` into a data.frame named `beers`. Read `/class/datamine/data/beer/breweries.csv` into a data.frame named `breweries`. Read `/class/datamine/data/beer/reviews.csv` into a data.frame named `reviews`. As in the previous project, make sure you used the `fread` function from the `data.table` package, and convert the `data.table` to a `data.frame`. We want to create a very basic beer recommender. We will start simple. Create a function called `recommend_a_beer` that takes as input `my_beer_id` (a single value) and returns a vector of `beer_ids` from the same `style`. Test your function on `2093`.

[TIP]
====
Make sure you do not include the given `my_beer_id` in the vector of `beer_ids` containing the `beer_ids`of your recommended beers.
====

[TIP]
====
You may find the function `setdiff` useful. Run the example below to get an idea of what it does.

[source,r]
----
x <- c('a','b','b','c')
y <- c('c','b','d','e','f')
setdiff(x,y)
setdiff(y,x)
----

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve the problem.
- Length of result from `recommend_a_beer(2093)`.
- The result of `2093 %in% recommend_a_beer(2093)`.
====

=== Question 2

That is a lot of beer recommendations! Let's try to narrow it down. Include an argument in your function called `min_score` with default value of 4.5. Our recommender will only recommend `beer_ids` with a review score of at least `min_score`. Test your improved beer recommender with the same `beer_id` from question (1).

[TIP]
====
Note that now we need to look at both `beers` and `reviews` datasets.

====
- R code used to solve the problem.
- Length of result from `recommend_a_beer(2093)`.
====

=== Question 3

There is still room for improvement (obviously) for our beer recommender. Include a new argument in your function called `same_brewery_only` with default value `FALSE`. This argument will determine whether or not our beer recommender will return only beers from the same brewery. Test our newly improved beer recommender with the same `beer_id` from question (1) with the argument `same_brewery_only` set to `TRUE`.

[TIP]
====
You may find the function `intersect` useful. Run the example below to get an idea of what it does.

[source,r]
----
x <- c('a','b','b','c')
y <- c('c','b','d','e','f')
intersect(x,y)
intersect(y,x)

- R code used to solve the problem.
- Length of result from `recommend_a_beer(2093, same_brewery_only=TRUE)`.
====

=== Question 4

Oops! Bad idea! Maybe including only beers from the same brewery is not the best idea. Add an argument to our beer recommender named `type`. If `type=style` our recommender will recommend beers based on the `style` as we did in question (3). If `type=reviewers`, our recommender will recommend beers based on reviewers with "similar taste". Select reviewers that gave score equal to or greater than `min_score` for the given beer id (`my_beer_id`). For those reviewers, find the `beer_ids` for other beers that these reviewers have given a score of at least `min_score`. These `beer_ids` are the ones our recommender will return. Be sure to test our improved recommender on the same `beer_id` as in (1)-(3).

====
- R code used to solve the problem.
- Length of result from `recommend_a_beer(2093, type="reviewers")`.
====

=== Question 5

Let's try to narrow down the recommendations. Include an argument called `abv_range` that indicates the abv range we would like the recommended beers to be at. Set `abv_range` default value to `NULL` so that if a user does not specify the `abv_range` our recommender does not consider it. Test our recommender for `beer_id` 2093, with `abv_range = c(8.9,9.1)` and `min_score=4.9`.

[TIP]
====
You may find the function `is.null` useful.

- R code used to solve the problem.
- Length of result from `recommend_a_beer(2093, abv_range=c(8.9, 9.1), type="reviewers", min_score=4.9)`.
====

=== Question 6

Play with our `recommend_a_beer` function. Include another feature to it. Some ideas are: putting a limit on the number of `beer_id`s we will return, error catching (what if we don't have reviews for a given `beer_id`?), including a plot to the output, returning beer names instead of ids or new arguments to decide what `beer_id`s to recommend. Be creative and have fun!

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve the problem.
- The result from running the improved `recommend_a_beer` function showcasing your improvements to it.
- 1-2 sentecens commenting on what you decided to include and why.
