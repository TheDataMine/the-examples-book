= STAT 29000: Project 6 -- Fall 2020

**Motivation:** A bash script is a powerful tool to perform repeated tasks. RCAC uses bash scripts to automate a variety of tasks. In fact, we use bash scripts on Scholar to do things like link Python kernels to your account, fix potential isues with Firefox, etc. `awk` is a programming language designed for text processing. The combination of these tools can be really powerful and useful for a variety of quick tasks.

**Context:** This is the first part in a series of projects that are designed to exercise skills around UNIX utilities, with a focus on writing bash scripts and `awk`. You will get the opportunity to manipulate data without leaving the terminal. At first it may seem overwhelming, however, with just a little practice you will be able to accomplish data wrangling tasks really efficiently. 

**Scope:** awk, UNIX utilities, bash scripts

.Learning objectives
****
- Use `awk` to process and manipulate textual data.
- Use piping and redirection within the terminal to pass around data between utilities.
****

== Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset found https://www.datadepot.rcac.purdue.edu/datamine/data/flights/subset/YYYY.csv[here] or in Scholar:

`/class/datamine/data/flights/subset/YYYY.csv` 

An example from 1987 data can be found https://www.datadepot.rcac.purdue.edu/datamine/data/flights/subset/1987.csv[here] or in Scholar:

`/class/datamine/data/flights/subset/1987.csv`

== Questions 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please make sure to **double check** that the your submission does indeed contain the files you think it does. You can do this by downloading your submission from Gradescope after uploading. If you can see all of your files and they open up properly on your computer, you should be good to go. 
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please make sure to look at your knit PDF *before* submitting. PDFs should be relatively short and not contain huge amounts of printed data. Remember you can use functions like `head` to print a sample of the data or output. Extremely large PDFs will be subject to lose points.
====


=== Question 1

In previous projects we learned how to get a single column of data from a csv file. Write 1 line of UNIX commands to print the 17th column, the `Origin`, from `1987.csv`. Write another line, this time using `awk` to do the same thing. Which one do you prefer, and why?

Here is an example, from a different data set, to illustrate some differences and similarities between cut and awk:

=== Question 2

Write a bash script that accepts a year (1987, 1988, etc.) and a column *n* and returns the *nth* column of the associated year of data.

Here are two examples to illustrate how to write a bash script:

[TIP]
====
In this example, you only need to turn in the content of your bash script (starting with `#!/bin/bash`) without evaluation in a code chunk. However, you should test your script before submission to make sure it works. To actually test out your bash script, take the following example. The script is simple and just prints out the first two arguments given to it:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
----
====

If you simply drop that text into a file called `my_script.sh`, located here: `/home/$USER/my_script.sh`, and if you run the following:

[source,bash]
----
# Setup bash to run; this only needs to be run one time per session.
# It makes bash behave a little more naturally in RStudio.
exec bash
# Navigate to the location of my_script.sh
cd /home/$USER
# Make sure that the script is runable.
# This only needs to be done one time for each new script that you write.
chmod 755 my_script.sh
# Execute my_script.sh
./my_script.sh okay cool
----

then it will print:

----
First argument: okay
Second argument: cool
----

In this example, if we were to turn in the "content of your bash script (starting with `#!/bin/bash`) in a code chunk, our solution would look like this:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
----

And although we aren't running the code chunk above, we know that it works because we tested it in the terminal.

[TIP]
====
Using `awk` you could have a script with just two lines: 1 with the "hash-bang" (`#!/bin/bash`), and 1 with a single `awk` command.

=== Question 3

Here is a similar example, using the election data set:

++++

.Items to submit
====
- One line of UNIX commands to solve the problem *without* using `awk`.
- One line of  UNIX commands to solve the problem using `awk`. 
- The number of flights that arrived at Indianapolis (IND) in 2008.
====

=== Question 4

Do you expect the number of unique origins and destinations to be the same based on flight data in the year 2008? Find out, using any command line tool you'd like. Are they indeed the same? How many unique values do we have per category (`Origin`, `Dest`)?

Here is an example to help you with the last part of the question, about Origin-to-Destination pairs.  We analyze the city-state pairs from the election data:

++++

.Items to submit
====
- 1-2 sentences explaining whether or not you expect the number of unique origins and destinations to be the same.
- The UNIX command(s) used to figure out if the number of unique origins and destinations are the same. 
- The number of unique values per category (`Origin`, `Dest`).
====

=== Question 5

In (4) we found that there are not the same number of unique `Origin` as `Dest`. Find the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_code#Airport_codes[IATA airport code] for all `Origin` that don't appear in a `Dest` and all `Dest` that don't appear in an `Origin` in the 2008 data.

[TIP]
====
The examples on https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/comm.htm[this page] should help. Note that these examples are based on https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html[Process Substitution] , which basically allows you to specify commands whose output would be used as the input of `comm`. There should be no space between the open bracket and open parenthesis, otherwise your bash will not work as intended.
====

.Items to submit
====
- The line(s) of UNIX command(s) used to answer the question.
- The list of all `Origin` that don't appear in `Dest`.
- The list of all `Dest` that don't appear in `Origin`.
====

=== Question 6

What was the percentage of flights in 2008 per unique `Origin` with the `Dest` of "IND"? What percentage of flights had "PHX" as `Origin` (among all flights with `Dest` of "IND")?

Here is an example using the percentages of donations contributed from CEOs from various States:

++++

[TIP]
====
You can do the mean calculation in awk by dividing the result from (3) by the number of unique `Origin` that have a `Dest` of "IND".
====

.Items to submit
====
- The percentage of flights in 2008 per unique `Origin` with the `Dest` of "IND".
- 1-2 sentences explaining how "PHX" compares (as a unique `ORIGIN`) to the other `Origin` (all with the `Dest` of "IND")?
====
