= TDM 20100: Project 8 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database. SQL can handle much larger amounts of data than R and Python can alone. SQL is incredibly powerful. Learning SQL is well worth your time!

**Context:** There are a multitude of RDBMSs (relational database management systems). Among the most popular are: MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql, and SQLite. As we've spent much of this semester in the terminal, we will start in the terminal using SQLite.

**Scope:** SQL, SQlite

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a database 
- Describe basic database concepts like: RDBMS, tables, fields, query, join, clause.
- Basic clauses: select, limit, where, from, etc.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

For this project, we will be using the `lahman` sqlite database. This database contains the data in the directory  

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/lahman`

You may get some more `lahman` database information from this youtube video http://youtube.com/watch?v=tS_-oTbsDzs
[2023 SABR Analytics:Sean Lahman, "introduction to Baseball Databases"]

To run SQL queries in a Jupyter Lab notebook, first run the following in a cell at the top of your notebook to establish a connection with the database.

[source,ipython]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/lahman/lahman.db
----

For every following cell where you want to run a SQL query, prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- just like we do for R or bash cells.

Get started by taking a look at the available tables in the Lahman database.

[loweralpha]
.. What tables are available in the Lahman database?

[TIP]
====
You'll want to prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- it should be the very first line of the cell (no comments or _anything_ else before it).

[source,ipython]
----
%%sql

-- Query here
----
 
In SQLite, you can show the tables using the following query:

[source, sql]
----
.tables
----

Unfortunately, SQLite-specific functions can't be run in a Jupyter Lab cell like that. Instead, we need to use a different query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';

.. It's always a good idea to learn what your table(s) looks like. A good way to do this is to get the first 5 rows of data from the table(s). Write and run queries that return the first 5 rows of data for the `people` table, the `batting` table, the `fielding` table, the `managers` table, and 2 more tables of your choice (you can pick any 2 more tables to consider).

.. To get a better idea of the size of the data, you can use the `count` clause to get the number of rows in each table. Write and run 6 queries that return the number of rows in each of these 6 tables.

[TIP]
====
Run each query in a separate cell, and remember to limit the query to return only 5 rows each.

You can use the `limit` clause to limit the number of rows returned.

Okay, let's dig into the `people` table a little bit. Run the following query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 5;
----

As you can see, every row has a `playerID` for each player. It is a unique identifier or key for the `people` table.  In Question 2, you checked several tables, so you might already notice that a few tables contain this `playerID` such as in table `batting`, `fielding`, `managers` etc.  The `playerID` relates data from those tables to the specific player.
[loweralpha]
.. Let us find information about a famous baseball player named `Mike Trout` from the `people` table.

[TIP]
====
The `WHERE` clause can be used to filter the results of a query.
Use table fields `nameLast` and `nameFirst` for the query.

Now you understand what the `playerID` means _inside_ the database.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM batting where playerID ='troutmi01'
----

The query will output all fields of data for Mike Trout from table `batting`
[loweralpha]
.. First use Mike Trout's `playerID` (from Question 3) to find the number of his home runs in each season.
.. Now make a second query that only displays Mike Trout's data for the year `2022` but includes the playerID, teamID, and number of home runs.

[TIP]
====
The `HR` field contains the number of home runs.

Now pick a different baseball player (your choice!) and find that baseball player's information in the database.

[loweralpha]

.. For this baseball player, please find the baseball player's information from the `people` table
.. Please use the `playerID` to get this player's number of home runs in the year 2022.
.. Please join the `people` table and the `batting` table, to display information from the fields of `nameLast`, `nameFirst`, `weight`, `height`, `birthYear`, and number of home runs in the year 2022, along with the `teamID`, and `yearID`.

[TIP]
====
You may refer to the following website for SQLite table join examples   https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-join/ 

Use `yearID` from the `batting` table for the Year.
