= TDM 10200: Project 5 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Once we have some data analysis working in Python, we often want to wrap it into a function.  Dr Ward usually tests anything that he wrote (usually 5 times), to make sure it works, before wrapping it into a function.  Once we are sure our analysis works, if we wrap it into a function, it can usually be easier to use.


**Context:**  Functions also help us to put our work into bite-size pieces that are easier to understand.  The basic idea is similar to functions from R or from other languages and tools. 

**Scope:** functions

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv


[TIP]
====
We have written several examples to get you started with functions https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/writing-functions[here].  All 6 of the videos for this project are given at the top of this page.  At the beginning, you probably only need to read the section on https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/writing-functions#arguments[Arguments].

[TIP]
====
If it helps, you also have a longer article available https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/[here]. It is a very detailed article going through many things that you can do with functions in Python.  In particular, the section on https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/#argument-passing[Argument Passing] might be helpful.

== Questions

=== ONE

Read in the dataset from Project 4

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv

and name it `cars`.

[loweralpha]
.. Write a function called `mycarcount` that takes two parameters: `cars` as a data frame, and `year` as an integer, and outputs the number of cars from that `year`.  (Alternatively, you can just use 1 argument, the `year`, as a parameter, and then read through the `cars` data frame inside the function.  Either way is OK.)
.. Run the function for each of the years from Project 4, Question 4, namely, for the years 2011, 1989, 1997.  Make sure that your answers agree with the results from that earlier project.

[TIP]
====
You can solve this question in a couple different ways.  You can either read in the entire dataset into a data frame called `cars` or you can read just a few lines at a time, using the `chunksize = 10000` and the `iterrows` like in the videos.  Either way is OK!

=== TWO


[loweralpha]
.. Run the function `mycarcount` for each year in the data set.  (Of course, be sure to only run it once for each year!)
.. Now make sure that the results agree, if you compare with the `value_counts()` from the `year` column.

[TIP]
====
It will take a long time to run `mycarcount` on each year in the data set, so you might want to start by running `mycarcount` on just a few years, for instance, on 5 years or 10 years, to make sure that things work, before running `mycarcount` on all of the years.

=== THREE

Use the csv data sets from this directory (the same as from Project 3):

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/


[loweralpha]
.. Write a function that takes two parameters: `myorigin` as a string with three characters, and `year` as an integer, and outputs the number of flights that depart during that year, from the `Origin` airport indicated in `myorigin`.
.. Test your function for a few years and airports of your choice.  You can choose!  Do your results look reasonable, i.e., do the airports in the big cities have lots of flights, compared to airports in smaller cities?
.. Run the function for each of the years from 1987 to 2008, checking how many flights depart from `IND` in each year.  Make sure that you use the method from the end of Project 3, Question 5.


[TIP]
====
For this question, you should not read the full data frame all at once, but instead, you should just a few lines at a time, using the `chunksize = 10000` and the `iterrows` like in the videos.
====


[TIP]
====
It will take a long time to run your function on each year in the data set, so you might want to start by running your function on just a few years, for instance, on 3 years or 5 years, to make sure that things work, before running your function on all of the years.

.Helpful Hint
[%collapsible]

[source,python]
----
total_count = 0
for df in pd.read_csv(putthefilenamehere, chunksize=10000):
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        if row['Origin'] == myorigin:
            total_count += 1

=== FOUR

Extend your function from Question 3 as follows:

[loweralpha]
.. Modify your function so that it takes three parameters: `myorigin` and `mydest` as strings that each have three characters, and `year` as an integer, and outputs the number of flights that depart during that year, from the `Origin` airport indicated in `myorigin`, and arrive at the `Dest` airport indicated in `mydest`.
.. Test your function for a few years and pairs of airports (origin and destination airports) of your choice.  Do the results look reasonable, e.g., if you compare popular flight paths, versus unpopular flight paths?
.. Run the function for each of the years from 1987 to 2008, checking how many flights depart from `IND` and arrive at `ORD` in each year.

[TIP]
====
Again, for this question, you should not read the full data frame all at once, but instead, you should just a few lines at a time, using the `chunksize = 10000` and the `iterrows` like in the videos.

=== FIVE


Use the csv data set for the DeathRecords from Project 2:

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv

[loweralpha]
.. Write a function that takes two parameters: `Sex` (which will be `F` or `M`) and `MaritalStatus` (`D` or `M` or `S` or `U` or `W`), and outputs the number of people with the indicated `Sex` and `MaritalStatus` in the data set.  (If you look at an earlier version of this question, in which we asked about the year of death, well, everyone in the data set died in 2014, so you do not need to worry about the year of death.)

You can solve this question in a couple different ways.  You can either read in the entire dataset into a data frame, or you can read just a few lines at a time, using the `chunksize = 10000` and the `iterrows` like in the videos.  Either way is OK!
