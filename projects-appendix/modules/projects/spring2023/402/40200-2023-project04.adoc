= TDM 40200: Project 4 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Dashboards are everywhere -- many of our corporate partners' projects are to build dashboards (or dashboard variants)! Dashboards are used to interactively visualize some set of data. Dashboards can be used to display, add, remove, filter, or complete some customized operation to data. Ultimately, a dashboard is really a website focused on displaying data. Dashboards are so popular, there are entire frameworks designed around making them with less effort, faster. Two of the more popular examples of such frameworks are https://shiny.rstudio.com/[`shiny`] (in R) and https://dash.plotly.com/introduction[`dash`] (in Python). While these tools are incredibly useful, it can be very beneficial to take a step back and build a dashboard (or website) from scratch (we are going to utilize many powerfuly packages and tools that make this far from "scratch", but it will still be more from scratch than those dashboard frameworks).

**Context:** This is the third in a series of projects focused around slowly building a dashboard. Students will have the opportunity to: create a backend (API) using `fastapi`, connect the backend to a database using `aiosql`, use the `jinja2` templating engine to create a frontend, use `htmx` to add "reactivity" to the frontend, create and use forms to insert data into the database, containerize the application so it can be deployed anywhere, and deploy the application to a cloud provider. Each week the project will build on the previous week, however, each week will be self-contained. This means that you can complete the project in any order, and if you miss a week, you can still complete the following project using the provided starting point.

**Scope:** Python, dashboards

=== Question 1

In the previous project we covered some of the most basic but important parts of a backend. It is time to take a break from `fastapi` -- before continuing on, it is important that we introduce probably the most critical component of a dashboard or web app -- the database. 

In this project we will be using `sqlite3` as our database. `sqlite3` is very simple to use, but still extremely powerful. Typically, however, an instance of `postgresql` or `mysql/mariadb` is more common. However, for this project, we will be using `sqlite3` as it is the easiest to get started with. We _will_ however explain the steps that would be needed if we were using either `postgresql` or `mariadb`.

Our code is Python code. There are a lot of Python packages that can be used to interact with the databases we've mentioned. We will be using https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/[`aiosql`] as it is a very straightforward package that allows us to write SQL queries in a `.sql` file, and then use those queries in our Python code. This is quite different than most of the other Python tools. Most of the Python tools -- like those used in Django, or `sqlalchemy` or `peewee` -- require us to write our SQL queries in Python code, and use special methods to execute those queries. While this isn't _bad_, and in fact, it can be very very good, however, it can be easier to maintain a project if we separate our SQL queries from our Python code -- this is what `aiosql` _largely_ let's us accomplish.

In this project, we will learn how to use `aiosql`.

Get started by opening up VS Code and connecting to Anvil, just as we have in the previous projects. One database you've used many times before is our `imdb` database. Please create a copy of this database in your `$SCRATCH` directory. You can do this by running the following command.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir $SCRATCH/p4
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db $SCRATCH/p4
----

In addition, create two additional files.

[source,bash]
----
touch $SCRATCH/p4/queries.sql
touch $SCRATCH/p4/project04.py
----

Finally, open `project04.py` and add the following code.

[source,python]
----
def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
----

Make sure things are working by loading up our Python environment and running `project04.py`.

[source,bash]
----
module use /anvil/projects/tdm/opt/core
module load tdm
module load python/f2022-s2023

cd $SCRATCH/p4
python3 project04.py
----

Capture a screenshot of the resulting output and include it in your Jupyter Notebook for submission.

=== Question 2

https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/[Here] are the official docs for `aiosql`. Please reference them as needed.

The first step, no matter what database you are using, is to load up the queries from our (currently empty) `queries.sql` file. Please glance over https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/database-driver-adapters.html[this] page.

As you can see, `aiosql` supports a number of different database drivers: `sqlite3`, `apsw`, `psycopg`, `psycopg2`, `pymysql`, etc. Please follow the following steps to load up our queries, and establish a database connection.

. Import `aiosql` and `sqlite3`. In this case, `sqlite3` is the database driver we are using. If you were instead using `postgresql`, you would likely import `psycopg2` instead.
. Next, you need to make a call to `aiosql` `from_path` method. This method takes two arguments -- the first is a string that describes a path to the file containing our queries, in our case, `queries.sql`. In this case, since our `project04.py` module and `queries.sql` files are in the same directory, this value can simply be "queries.sql". The second argument is the database driver we are using. In our case, this is `sqlite3`. If we were using `postgresql` and `psycopg2`, this would be `psycopg2`. You can name the resulting variable anything you want. For clarity, I tend to prefer `queries`. This resulting `queries` object will contain a _method_ for each and every query we have in our `queries.sql` file. We will explain this more, later.
. Finally, when making a query using `aiosql`, we need to establish a database connection object and pass that object along to each query we call. To establish a database connection, you need to follow the instructions for your database driver. In our case, we are using `sqlite3`. So, I would search the internet for "establish connection sqlite3 python" and find the following results: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html. We can very clearly see, that to establish a connection, we can run the following code.
+
[source,python]
----
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("imdb.db")
----
+
Of course, we need to make sure that `imdb.db` is in the same directory as our `project04.py` module. If it isn't, we would need to adjust the _path_ of the database accordingly. Here, the resulting `conn` is our _connection object_. We will need to pass this object to every query we make using `aiosql` -- it will always be the first argument.
+
[NOTE]
====
To create a connection using `psycopg2`, for example, this would look a bit different.

[source,python]
----
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(host="my.db.location.example.com", database="mydbname", user="myusername", password="mypassword", port=5432)
----

Here, we would have to specify more details as `postgresql` is a client/server database and we need to authenticate. In addition, we have to specify _where_ (the host) the database is hosted and what port it is listening on.
====

Finally, its time to put all of this information to use! Carefully read https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/defining-sql-queries.html[this] page. In your `queries.sql` file, write a query called `get-five-titles` that runs a `SELECT` query returning 5 titles. Update your `main` function to load your queries from the `queries.sql` file, establishes a connection to the `imdb.db` `sqlite3` database, and executes the newly created query, printing the results. From the terminal, run the updated `project04.py` module and capture a screenshot of the resulting output and include it in your Jupyter Notebook for submission.

[TIP]
====
If all went well you should end up with something like:

.output
----
[('tt0000001', 'short', 'Carmencita', 'Carmencita', 0, 1894, None, 1, 'Documentary,Short'), ('tt0000002', 'short', 'Le clown et ses chiens', 'Le clown et ses chiens', 0, 1892, None, 5, 'Animation,Short'), ('tt0000003', 'short', 'Pauvre Pierrot', 'Pauvre Pierrot', 0, 1892, None, 4, 'Animation,Comedy,Romance'), ('tt0000004', 'short', 'Un bon bock', 'Un bon bock', 0, 1892, None, 12, 'Animation,Short'), ('tt0000005', 'short', 'Blacksmith Scene', 'Blacksmith Scene', 0, 1893, None, 1, 'Comedy,Short')]

=== Question 3

Next, write a new query called `get-title-by-id` that takes a single argument, `title_id`, and returns the title (and only the `primary_title`) with the matching `title_id`. Update your `main` function to load your queries from the `queries.sql` file, establishes a connection to the `imdb.db` `sqlite3` database, and executes the newly created query, printing the results. From the terminal, run the updated `project04.py` module and capture a screenshot of the resulting output and include it in your Jupyter Notebook for submission.

[TIP]
====
Here are some example queries with expected output.

[source,python]
----
results = queries.get_title_by_id(conn, title_id="tt4236770")
print(results)
----

.expected output
----
[('Yellowstone',)]
----

[source,python]
----
results = queries.get_title_by_id(conn, title_id="tt0108778")
print(results)
----

.expected output
----
[('Friends',)]

=== Question 4

Carefully read https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/defining-sql-queries.html#operators[this section] if you haven't already. Now it is time to insert a new title into our `titles` table!

Write a new query called `insert-title` that takes the following arguments: `title_id`, `type`, `primary_title`, `original_title`, `is_adult`, `premiered`, `ended`, `runtime_minutes`, and `genres`. The query should insert a new row into the `titles` table with the provided values. 

Use your new query to insert the following title into the `titles` table: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/. Make sure `title_id` is `tt3581920`, however, if you can't find any of the other pieces of data, feel free to make them up.

Test out your new query from within your `main` function. From the terminal, run the updated `project04.py` module. Be sure to use the `get_title_by_id` method to fetch and print the newly added title to confirm your `INSERT` worked properly. Capture a screenshot of the resulting output and include it in your Jupyter Notebook for submission.

=== Question 5

Great job! I hope you will start to see the advantages of having all your queries in a single place. Write an additional query using a different https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/defining-sql-queries.html#operators[operator] than you've used so far. Demonstrate that your query functions as it should by executing it from within your `main` function. From the terminal, run the updated `project04.py` module and capture a screenshot of the resulting output and include it in your Jupyter Notebook for submission.
