= STAT 39000: Project 10 -- Fall 2020

**Motivation:** Although SQL syntax may still feel unnatural and foreign, with more practice it _will_ start to make more sense. The ability to read and write SQL queries is a bread-and-butter skill for anyone working with data. 

**Context:** We are in the second of a series of projects that focus on learning the basics of SQL. In this project, we will continue to harden our understanding of SQL syntax, and introduce common SQL functions like `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

**Scope:** SQL, sqlite

.Learning objectives
****
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a database over a tool like a spreadsheet.
- Describe basic database concepts like: rdbms, tables, indexes, fields, query, clause.
- Basic clauses: select, order by, limit, desc, asc, count, where, from, etc.
- Utilize SQL functions like min, max, avg, sum, and count to solve data-driven problems.
****

== Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset similar to the one from Project 9, but this time we will use a MariaDB version of the database, which is also hosted on Scholar, at `scholar-db.rcac.purdue.edu`.
As in Project 9, this is the Lahman Baseball Database.  You can find its documentation http://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2017.txt[here], including the definitions of the tables and columns.

== Questions 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please make sure to **double check** that the your submission does indeed contain the files you think it does. You can do this by downloading your submission from Gradescope after uploading. If you can see all of your files and they open up properly on your computer, you should be good to go. 
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please make sure to look at your knit PDF *before* submitting. PDFs should be relatively short and not contain huge amounts of printed data. Remember you can use functions like `head` to print a sample of the data or output. Extremely large PDFs will be subject to lose points.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this project all solutions should be done using R code chunks, and the `RMariaDB` package. Run the following code to load the library:

[source,r]
----
library(RMariaDB)
----
====

=== Question 1

Connect to RStudio Server https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu, and, rather than navigating to the terminal like we did in the previous project, instead, create a connection to our MariaDB lahman database using the `RMariaDB` package in R, and the credentials below. Confirm the connection by running the following code chunk:

[source,r]
----
con <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
                 host="scholar-db.rcac.purdue.edu", 
                 db="lahmandb", 
                 user="lahman_user", 
                 password="HitAH0merun")
head(dbGetQuery(con, "SHOW tables;"))
----

[TIP]
====
In the example provided, the variable `con` from the `dbConnect` function is the connection. Each query that you make, using the `dbGetQuery`, needs to use this connection `con`.  You can change the name `con` if you want to (it is user defined), but if you change the name `con`, you need to change it on all of your connections.  If your connection to the database dies while you are working on the project, you can always re-run the `dbConnect` line again, to reset your connection to the database.
====

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve the problem.
- Output from running your (potentially modified) `head(dbGetQuery(con, "SHOW tables;"))`.
====

=== Question 2

How many players are members of the 40/40 club? These are players that have stolen at least 40 bases (`SB`) and hit at least 40 home runs (`HR`) in one year.

[TIP]
====
Use the `batting` table.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You only need to run `library(RMariaDB)` and the `dbConnect` portion of the code a single time towards the top of your project. After that, you can simply reuse your connection `con` to run queries. 
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In our xref:current-projects:templates.adoc[project template], for this project, make all of the SQL queries using the `dbGetQuery` function, which returns the results directly in `R`.  Therefore, your `RMarkdown` blocks for this project should all be `{r}` blocks (as opposed to the `{sql}` blocks used in Project 9).
====

[TIP]
====
You can use `dbGetQuery` to run your queries from within R. Example:

[source,r]
----
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM battings LIMIT 5;")
----
====

[NOTE]
====
We already demonstrated the correct SQL query to use for the 40/40 club in the video below, but now we want you to use `RMariaDB` to solve this query.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Questions in this project need to be solved using SQL when possible. You will not receive credit for a question if you use `sum` in R rather than `SUM` in SQL. 
====

[TIP]
====
Use the `people` table to find the `playerID` and use the `batting` table to find the statistics.
====

.Items to submit

- R code used to solve the problem.
- The result of running the R code.
====

=== Question 4

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)[Batting Average] is a metric for a batter's performance. The Batting Average in a year is calculated by stem:[\frac{H}{AB}] (the number of hits divided by at-bats).  Considering (only) the years between 2000 and 2010, calculate the (seasonal) Batting Average for each batter who had more than 300 at-bats in a season. List the top 5 batting averages next to `playerID`, `teamID`, and `yearID.`

[TIP]
====
Use the `batting` table.

=== Question 5

How many unique players have hit > 50 home runs (`HR`) in a season? 

[TIP]
====
If you view `DISTINCT` as being paired with `SELECT`, instead, think of it as being paired with one of the fields you are selecting.
====

.Items to submit
====
- R code used to solve the problem.
- The result of running the R code.
====

=== Question 6

Find the number of unique players that attended Purdue University. Start by finding the `schoolID` for Purdue and then find the number of players who played there. Do the same for IU. Who had more? Purdue or IU? Use the information you have in the database, and the power of R to create a misleading graphic that makes Purdue look better than IU, even if just at first glance. Make sure you label the graphic.

[TIP]
====
Use the `schools` table to get all `schoolID` and the `collegeplaying` table to get the statistics.
====

[TIP]
====
You can mess with the scale of the y-axis. You could (potentially) filter the data to start from a certain year or be between two dates.
====

[TIP]
====
To find IU's id, try the following query: `SELECT schoolID FROM schools WHERE name_full LIKE '%indiana%';`. You can find more about the LIKE clause and `%` https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-like-clause.htm[here].

=== Question 7

Use R, SQL and the lahman database to create an interesting infographic. For those of you who are not baseball fans, try doing a Google image search for "baseball plots" for inspiration. Make sure the plot is polished, has appropriate labels, color, etc.
