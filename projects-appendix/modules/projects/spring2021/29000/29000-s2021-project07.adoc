= STAT 29000: Project 7 -- Spring 2021

**Motivation:** Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is a skill that is invaluable in _many_ fields. It can be pretty fun too! As you probably noticed in the previous project, `matplotlib` can be finicky -- certain types of plots are really easy to create, while others are not. For example, you would think changing the color of a boxplot would be easy to do in `matplotlib`, perhaps we just need to add an option to the function call. As it turns out, this isn't so straightforward (as illustrated at the end of [this section](#p-matplotlib-boxplot)). Occasionally this will happen and that is when packages like `seaborn` or `plotnine` (both are packages built using `matplotlib`) can be good. In this project we will explore this a little bit, and learn about some useful `pandas` functions to help shape your data in a format that any given package requires.

**Context:** In the next project, we will continue to learn about and become comfortable using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotnine`.

**Scope:** python, visualizing data

.Learning objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
- Demonstrate the ability to customize a plot (color, shape/linetype).
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset found in Scholar:

`/class/datamine/data/apple/health/watch_dump.xml`

== Questions

=== Question 1

In an earlier project we explored some XML data in the form of an Apple Watch data dump. Most health-related apps give you some sort of graph or set of graphs as an output. Use any package you want to parse the XML data. `Record` is a dense category in this dataset. Each `Record` has an attribute called `creationDate`. Create a barplot of the number of `Records` per day. Make sure your plot is polished, containing proper labels and good colors.

[TIP]
====
You could start by parsing out the required data into a `pandas` dataframe or series.
====

[TIP]
====
The `groupby` method is one of the most useful `pandas` methods. It allows you to quickly perform operations on groups of data.

.Items to submit
====
- Python code used to solve the problem.
- Output from running your code (including the graphic).
====

=== Question 2

The plot in question 1 should look bimodal. Let's focus only on the first apparent group of readings. Create a new dataframe containing only the readings for the time period from 9/1/2017 to 5/31/2019. How many `Records` are there in that time period?

=== Question 3

It is hard to discern weekly patterns (if any) based on the graphics created so far. For the period of time in question 2, create a labeled bar plot for the count of `Record` by day of the week. What (if any) discernable patterns are there? Make sure to include the labels provided below:

[source,python]
----
labels = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
----

- Output from running your code (including the graphic).
====

=== Question 4

Create a `pandas` dataframe containing the following data from `watch_dump.xml`:

- A column called `bpm` with the `bpm` (beats per minute) of the `InstantaneousBeatsPerMinute`.
- A column called `time` with the `time` of each individual `bpm` reading in `InstantaneousBeatsPerMinute`.
- A column called `date` with the date.
- A column called `dayofweek` with the day of the week.

[TIP]
====
You may want to use `pd.to_numeric` to convert the `bpm` column to a numeric type.
====

[TIP]
====
This is one way to convert the numbers 0-6 to days of the week:

[source,python]
----
myDF['dayofweek'] = myDF['dayofweek'].map({0:"Mon", 1:"Tue", 2:"Wed", 3:"Thu", 4:"Fri", 5: "Sat", 6: "Sun"})

=== Question 5

Create a heatmap using `seaborn`, where the y-axis shows the day of the week ("Mon" - "Sun"), the x-axis shows the hour, and the values on the interior of the plot are the average `bpm` by hour by day of the week.
