= TDM 10200: Project 8 -- 2024

**Motivation:** We will continue to introduce functions and visualization

**Context:**  Write functions with visualizations

**Scope:** python, functions, pandas, matplotlib, Parquet columnar storage file format

== Datasets

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/weather.parquet`

[IMPORTANT]
====
We added https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/some-examples-for-TDM-10200-project-8[eleven new videos] to help you with Project 8.
====

[WARNING]
====
You need to use 3 cores for your Jupyter Lab session for Project 8 this week.
====

[TIP]
====
You can use `pd.read_parquet` to read in a `parquet` file (very similarly to how you use `pd.read_csv` to read in a `csv` file!)

You can use `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` if you want to see all of the columns in a very wide data frame.

== Questions 
 

=== Question 1 (2 points)

Read the file into a DataFrame called `myDF`.

.. Convert the `observation_time` column to into a `datetime` type.
.. Create 3 new columns for the `year`, `month` and `day`, based on the column `observation_time`.
.. For a given `station_id`, calculate the average month-and-year-pair temperatures (from the column `temperature`) for that `station_id`.  Try this for a few different `station_id` values.
.. Now write a function called `get_avg_temp` that takes one `station_id` as input and returns the average month-and-year-pair temperatures (associated with that specific `station_id`).  Make sure that the results of your function match with your work from question 1c.

=== Question 2 (2 points)

For this function, be sure to `import matplotlib.pyplot`.

We will use the function from question 1d to make some line plots.

.. For a given `station_id`, create a line plot, with one line for each year.  Try this for a few different `station_id` values.
.. Now that you are sure your analysis from 2a works well, wrap your work from question 2a into a function that takes a `station_id` as input, and creates a line plot, with one line for each year (for the average month-and-year-pair temperatures from that `station_id`).

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Revisit the function from question 1d, to find the maximum temperature (instead of the average temperature) in each month-and-year-pair, for a given station.  As before, you should test this for several examples before you build the function, and then make sure your function matches your examples.
.. Revisit the function from question 2b, to make a function that takes one `station_id` as input and it creates a bar plot (instead of a line plot), depicting the maximum temperature in each month-and-year-pair (instead of the average temperature).

[TIP]
====
Your work from question 3b can utilize the function you build in question 3a.
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. For a given `station_id`, create a box plot that shows the month-by-month wind speeds in 2020 for that specified `station_id`.  Try this for a few different `station_id` values.
..  Write a function that takes a `year` (not necessarily 2020) and a `station_id` as inputs, and the function creates a box plot about the month-by-month wind speeds in that specific year (not necessarily 2020), at the specified `station_id`.
 

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Explore the dateset and find something interesting, like (for instance) something about the wind speed, pressure, soil temperature, etc., and do some analysis.
.. Make a visualization that shows one or more plots about your analysis.
.. Wrap the work 5a and 5b into a function that can be used to create the visualizations in a systematic way, and test the function with the same inputs used in 5a and 5b.
