== Project Objectives

This project will focus on Image Classification. In this project, we will build up multiple types of image classification datasets, and train multiple models on these datasets to see their performance. The classifiers we make will be very simple, but they will give us a good idea of various techniques we can use to classify images.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
For this project, please use 2 CPU cores instead of the default 1 core.
====

In this project, we will continue to use our dataset of high quality ice cream images. If you look through this folder of images, you should notice that there are primarily 3 different types of ice cream images: Scoops of ice cream in a bowl, ice cream bars, and cutouts of pines of ice cream. We will build a classifier to classify these images into one of these three categories.

To make things easier for you, here is a dictionary containing the file names grouped into their correct labels:

[source,python]
----
labeled = {
    "scoop": ["0_hd.png", "1_hd.png", "2_hd.png", "3_hd.png", "4_hd.png", "6_hd.png", "8_hd.png", "9_hd.png", "11_hd.png", "12_hd.png", "15_hd.png", "16_hd.png", "17_hd.png", "18_hd.png", "21_hd.png", "23_hd.png", "25_hd.png", "26_hd.png", "27_hd.png", "29_hd.png", "30_hd.png", "31_hd.png", "33_hd.png", "34_hd.png", "36_hd.png", "37_hd.png", "38_hd.png", "40_hd.png", "41_hd.png", "43_hd.png", "45_hd.png", "46_hd.png", "47_hd.png", "48_hd.png", "49_hd.png", "52_hd.png", "53_hd.png", "55_hd.png", "56_hd.png", "59_hd.png", "61_hd.png", "64_hd.png", "67_hd.png", "68_hd.png"],
    "bar": ["5_hd.png", "7_hd.png", "10_hd.png", "13_hd.png", "14_hd.png", "20_hd.png", "22_hd.png", "42_hd.png", "44_hd.png", "50_hd.png", "60_hd.png", "65_hd.png", "66_hd.png", "69_hd.png"],
    "cutout": ["19_hd.png", "24_hd.png", "35_hd.png", "51_hd.png", "54_hd.png", "57_hd.png", "62_hd.png", "63_hd.png"]
}
----

Our first step is to load all of these images into a simple dataset. Please load all images into a dictionary named `labeled_images_loaded` of the same format as above, but instead of the file names, store the actual images. We recommend using the `cv2.imread()` function to load the images.

[NOTE]
====
The values in each list are just the names of the file. Our dataset is in the folder `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/hd/images/`. You can either simply append the file name to the end of the path with normal string concatenation, or use the more robust `os.path.join()` function to combine the path and the file name. Additionally, you can choose to convert from BGR to RGB color space. It is not required for this project, as the classifier does not need to understand the difference between BGR and RGB, it's all the same to it. However, if you want to display the images later, they will look more normal in RGB.
====

After your done, please run the below 2 blocks of code to ensure that your code is correct: 

Block 1:
[source,python]
----
print(len(labeled_images_loaded["scoop"]) == 44)
print(len(labeled_images_loaded["bar"]) == 14)
print(len(labeled_images_loaded["cutout"]) == 8)

print(labeled_images_loaded["scoop"][0].shape)
print(labeled_images_loaded["bar"][0].shape)
print(labeled_images_loaded["cutout"][0].shape)
----

Block 2:
[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 9))

axes[0].imshow(labeled_images_loaded["scoop"][0])
axes[0].set_title("Scoops of Ice Cream")
axes[0].axis("off")

axes[1].imshow(labeled_images_loaded["bar"][0])
axes[1].set_title("Ice Cream Bars")
axes[1].axis("off")

axes[2].imshow(labeled_images_loaded["cutout"][0])
axes[2].set_title("Cutout Ice Cream")
axes[2].axis("off")

plt.show()

=== Question 2 (2 points)

If you look at what these code blocks are doing, you can see that one part is outputting the shape of the first image in each category, and the other part is displaying the first image in each category. If you are observant, you may notice that the select scoop image is smaller than the other images. Additionally, if you investigate the size of each image in each category, not all of them are the same size either. If we were to train a model directly on these images, the model may be confused by the different image sizes, so it is a good idea to resize all of the images to the same size. Another reason we may want to resize the images is to reduce the amount of computation required to train the model. Larger images have more pixels which means more computations, exponentially so. Please resize all of the images to be 128x128 pixels. Please place these results into a new dictionary named `labeled_images_resized` of the same format as `labeled_images_loaded`.

[NOTE]
====
You should remember how to resize images from Project 2. Please look back at that project if you need a refresher. Please use `cv2.INTER_AREA` as the interpolation method.
====

After your done, please run the below block of code to ensure that your code is correct (if it is correct, no output will be produced):

[source,python]
----
correct_size = (128,128,3)
for k,v in labeled_images_resized.items():
    sizes = [im.shape for im in v]
    if not all([s == correct_size for s in sizes]):
        print("Not all images are the correct size")
        break
----

Then, output the resized images using the below block of code:

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 9))

axes[0].imshow(labeled_images_resized["scoop"][0])
axes[0].set_title("Scoops of Ice Cream")
axes[0].axis("off")

axes[1].imshow(labeled_images_resized["bar"][0])
axes[1].set_title("Ice Cream Bars")
axes[1].axis("off")

axes[2].imshow(labeled_images_resized["cutout"][0])
axes[2].set_title("Cutout Ice Cream")
axes[2].axis("off")

plt.show()

- All images resized to the same size
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

Now that our images are the same size, we need to convert them into a format that our model can understand. Firstly, we need to flatten the image into a 1D array. Then, we need to convert our `label: image array` format into an `array of images: array of labels` format. This can be accomplished with the below code block. Please fill in the missing code:

[source,python]
----
import numpy as np

# create an array of images flattened into 1D arrays using labeled_images_resized
images = # your code here

# create an array of labels using labeled_images_resized
labels = # your code here

# convert to float32, proper format for OpenCV
images = images.astype(np.float32)
# Convert string labels to integers
labels = np.array([0 if l == "scoop" else 1 if l == "bar" else 2 for l in labels])
----

Now that your data is in the correct format, let's train our classifier. It's been a while since we've looked at machine learning, but hopefully you remember the extremely extremely important idea of train/test split. Last semester, we used the `train_test_split()` function from `sklearn.model_selection` to split our datasets into training and testing sets. This function randomly splits the dataset into these two sets, however it does not guarantee that each class will be represented equally in each set by default. If you recall from Question 1, the number of images in each category varies greatly. In order to ensure that our splits are representative of the entire dataset, we need to stratify our split. For example, if our split was 80% training and 20% testing, we would want 80% of the scoop images, 80% of the bar images, and 80% of the cutout images in the training set, and the remaining 20% in the testing set. This can be accomplished by setting the `stratify` parameter in `train_test_split()` equal to the labels array you just created. Please use `train_test_split()` to split the data into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data in the training set and 20% in the testing set, using a random_state of 60. Please save the results into variables named `train_images`, `test_images`, `train_labels`, and `test_labels`.

[source,python]
----
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# split the data into training and testing sets, stratifying by the labels
# your code here
----

To ensure that your code is correct, please print out the length of the train and test sets, as well as the shape of the first image in each set. 

Now that we have our train/test split, let's train a simple classifier. We will use the `cv2.ml.KNearest_create()` function to create a k-nearest neighbors classifier. Then, we will train the classifier using the `train()` method. Please read and run the below code block:

[source,python]
----
knn_model = cv2.ml.KNearest_create()

# train the model using the train_images and train_labels
knn_model.train(train_images, cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE, train_labels) # the cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE flag tells OpenCV that the samples are in rows, not columns. This is the default for numpy arrays, but we need to specify it here.

# test the model using the test_images and test_labels
'''
This will find all the k nearest neighbors for each image in the test set, and return the results. The results array is the predicted label for each image in the test set. However, this function also returns all the neighbors and distances too those neighbors, which can be useful if you wanted to make a weighted voting system, or something more complex like we did last semester with the weighted KNN. However, for this assignment, we will just be using the results.
'''
ret, results, neighbors, dist = knn_model.findNearest(test_images, k=1)

# calculate the accuracy of the model by comparing the results to the test_labels
accuracy = np.mean(results.flatten() == test_labels)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
----

How well did the model perform? If you did everything correctly, you should have gotten a model with a pretty high accuracy (The accuracy may vary depending on how you split the data, particularly the order in which you shuffle the data). 

[NOTE]
====
If your model did not perform well, you may have made a mistake. It is recommended to go back and check your work. If you have any questions or concerns, Piazza and office hours are great resources to get help.
====

Now that we have a working model, let's see how efficient our model is. Please use the time library to measure the time it takes to train the model, and the time it takes to test the model. Save these in variables named `train_time_color` and `test_time_color` respectively. Please print out these values.

=== Question 4 (2 points)

Now that we've seen how our model performs with color images, let's lower the amount of data even further by converting the images to grayscale. Please start back at the `labeled_images_resized` dictionary, convert all images to grayscale, save them in `labeled_images_grayscale` dictionary, and repeat the process from the previous question

[NOTE]
====
Save the times it takes to train and test the model with grayscale images in variables named `train_time_gray` and `test_time_gray` respectively. Please print out these values.
====

.Deliverables
====
- Accuracy of the model with grayscale images
- Time it took to train the model with grayscale images
- Time it took to test the model with grayscale images

=== Question 5 (2 points)

We can even further compress our images by making them binary. We can simply use Otsu's method to binarize the image with `cv2.threshold()`. Please start at the `labeled_images_grayscale` dictionary, binarize all images, and repeat the process from the previous question.  Save the times it takes to train and test the model with Otsu's binary images in variables named `train_time_otsu` and `test_time_otsu` respectively. Please print out these values.

After we have these 3 models, please compare the accuracy and time it took to train and test each model. Which model was the most accurate? Which model was the fastest? Which model was the slowest? Which model do you think is the best overall?

.Deliverables
====
- Accuracy of the model with Otsu's binary images
- Time it took to train the model with Otsu's binary images
- Time it took to test the model with Otsu's binary images
- A comparison of the accuracy and time it took to train and test each model
====

=== Question 6 (2 points)

Instead of performing direct classification based on the pixels of the image, we could use other algorithms to extract information from the image and use that information to classify the image. For example, we could extract features from the image using edge detection, corner detection, or other feature detectors. Then, with these features, we could train a classifier. This is known as feature-based classification. In this question, we will be using SIFT to extract features from each image in the dataset, and use those features to train a classifier. We will use the grayscale images from question 4 as our starting point. Please start at the `labeled_images_grayscale` dictionary, extract SIFT features from all images, and repeat the process from the previous question. Save the times it takes to train and test the model with SIFT features in variables named `train_time_sift` and `test_time_sift` respectively. Please print out these values.

[NOTE]
====
We should ensure that all images have the same number of features. We can do this by setting the `nfeatures` parameter in `cv2.SIFT_create()` to a specific value. For this question, please set it to 20. Additionally, we only need to store the descriptors, not the key points. The descriptors are the features that we will use to train the classifier. 
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are having problems where `nfeatures` is not doing its job correctly (i.e. not outputting the same number of features for each image), you should splice the descriptor arrays to the correct size e.g. `des = des[:20]`. 
====

After you've completed the above, please answer the following questions:

- How does this model compare to the previous 3 models in terms of accuracy?
- How does it compare in terms of time?
- Which model do you think is the best overall?
