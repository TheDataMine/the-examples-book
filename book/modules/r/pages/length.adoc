= `length`

== Description

`length` is a very simple R function that returns the number of elements in an object, usually a vector. 

[source,R]
----
# Create a vector of length 5
my_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# Calculate the length of my_vector
length(my_vector)
----

----
[1] 5

== `nchar`

It's important to note that unlike Python, `length` will not work for calculating the length of a string. Take the following example: 

[source,R]
----
vector <- "OH YEAH!"
length(vector)
----

----
[1] 1
----

Our string `vector` is one object consisting of multiple characters, and since `length` returns the number of _objects_, we will get 1. If we use the `nchar` function, we get what we want: 

[source,R]
----
vector <- "OH YEAH!"
nchar(vector)
----

----
[1] 8
