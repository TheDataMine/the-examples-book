= `min`

`min` is a simple function which returns the minimum value in a vector or column in a data.frame. This can be used to compare the minimum values between columns, find the minimum value of a row, or find a string that's alphabetically first in a list.

== Examples

=== What is the smallest value in the vector `weights`?

=== How do I get the minimum of the values in a vector when some of the values are: `NA`, `NaN`?

vec <- c(NA, 45, 444, 13, 98, NA)
max(vec, na.rm = TRUE)

----
[1] 13

[WARNING]
====
If we don't include the `na.rm = TRUE` argument, the function will only return `NA` and we won't get any meaningful information out of the code.
