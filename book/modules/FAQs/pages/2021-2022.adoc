== My kernel crashes every time I try to load the rpy2 extension: `%load_ext rpy2.ipython`

Launch a Jupyter Lab session on https://ondemand.brown.rcac.purdue.edu. Once launched, instead of selecting a kernel (for example `f2021-s2022`), there should be an option to instead launch a Terminal session. Once launched, you can run the following commands to fix this issue:

[source,bash]
----
mv $HOME/.ipython $HOME/.ipython.bak
rm $HOME/.RData
----

== I get a "permission denied" error when trying to make a Jupyter notebook or launch the "f2021-s2022" kernel

Make sure you are currently inside your `$HOME` directory and not in the Data Depot. To switch to your `$HOME` directory in Jupyter Lab, in the left-hand menu, click on the little Folder icon. Then, directly above the list of files you see, you will see another _smaller_ Folder icon, followed by some forward slashes and directory names. Click on the small Folder icon and this will present you with a list of directories in your `$HOME` directory. Now that you are in your `$HOME` directory, try to create your notebook again.
