Here, the `.` represents a _relative path_ to the current directory, 
or the directory that the program or code was run from. Let's say
we have the following directory tree.

----
temp
├── grades.csv <1>
└── some_directory
    └── grades.csv <2>

1 directory, 2 files
----

If we ran the solution inside the `temp` directory, our code would read in <1>. If
we ran the solution inside the `some_directory` directory, our code would read in <2>.
