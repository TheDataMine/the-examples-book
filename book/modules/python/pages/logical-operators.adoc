= Logical Operators

== Overview 
Logical operators are key components of Python and allow for efficient comparisons between data and data types. A high level table of the different types of logical operators is included below: 

[cols="2*"]
|===
^|Operator ^|Description

^|`<` 
| less than

^|`\<=` 
| less than or equal to

^|`>` 
| greater than

^|`>=` 
| greater than or equal to

^|`==` 
| equal to

^|`!=` 
| not equal to

^|`not x` 
| negation, not x

^|`x or y` 
| x OR y

^|`x and y` 
| x AND y

^|`x is y` 
| x and y both point to the same objects in memory

^|`x == y` 
| x and y have the same values
|===

It may be important to give a quick example of the difference between `==` and `is`: 

In Python the `==` operator is checking to see if the values are the same while the `is` operator is checking to see if they occupy the same space in memory. We can see this behavior in an example below:

[source, python]
----
list_1 = [1, 2, 3]
list_2 = [1, 2, 3]

print(list_1 == list_2)
print(list_1 is list_2) #Is anyone really list_2?
----

----
True
False
----

We can illustrate this even further if we check the ID's associate with each list in memory. Note, the exact number may change for your Python instance: 

[source, python]
----
print(id(list_1))
print(id(list_2))
----
