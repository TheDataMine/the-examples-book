= Docstrings & Comments

Well-commented code is easier to maintain and understand than un-commented code. Adding clear and concise comments to your code is not necessary in order for your code to work. It _does_ however impact the readability, and maintainability, of your code. The individual who will inherit your codebase will greatly appreciate useful notes -- who knows, that individual may end up being you! Do yourself a favor, and adopt a consistent style of commenting your Python code.

== Comments

Comments in Python start with a `#` and continue to the end of the line. Comments are ignored by the interpreter, and have no functional purpose other than to help humans understand the code.

The following is an example of an inline comment. An inline comment is a comment that follows code in the same line. While the code itself is not ignored by the interpreter, the comment _following_ the code _is_.

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

myDF = pd.read_csv("/path/to/my.csv") # read in the csv file
----

Is this an example of a good comment? No, it is not. Comments should only be added to snippets of code that are non-obvious. In this case, what the code does is nearly in sentence-form -- it reads in a csv file. Sometimes, as the writer of code, a problem or snippet of code you write may be clear to you because you took the time to understand it before writing it. When in doubt, it is usually better to write a comment than to leave it out.

Multi-line comments are also possible in Python, but not in a way that is as convenient as a language like c, for example. In c, you could add a multi-line comment like this.

[source,c]
----
/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    Each line I add here will be ignored
    until I close the comment.
*/
----

In Python, you can do the same thing, but it is not as convenient.

[source,python]
----
# This is a multi-line comment.
# Each line I add here will be ignored
# but it still needs to start with a #
----

== Docstrings

The primary way to document code in Python, is to use docstrings. Docstrings are central to documenting your code. If you had to choose a single method to document a project in Python, it would be the docstring. _Every_ single module should have a module-level docstring. _Every_ single class should have a docstring. _Every_ single method should have a docstring. _Every_ single function should have a docstring.

So, what does a docstring look like? The following is an example Python module (a `.py` file) with an example of each type of docstring.

.mymodule.py
[source,python]
----
""" <1>
This is a module-level docstring. It goes at the very top of the file, and describes the module.

Often times the module-level docstring will give examples showing how to use the module, and maybe
even contain some info about things that are still left TODO.

<1> This is a module-level docstring. It goes at the very top of the file, and describes the module. Often times this docstring will contain usage examples and information about things that are still in a todo list.

<2> This is function-level docstring. This docstring is written in the Google-style. This style of docstring makes your code comments consistent, easy to read, and easy to maintain.

<3> This is another function-level docstring.

<4> This is a function-level docstring for the class's __init__ method.

<5> This is a function-level docstring for the class's is_datamine_affiliated method.

What do docstrings _do_ other than provide info for the reader? Docstrings actually have a functional purpose, unlike regular comments.

This allows for powerful code introspection, and automated documentation generation using a tool like xref:book:python:pdoc.adoc[pdoc, for example].

It is highly recommended to pick a good docstring style, for example, the https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings[Google style], and stick with it and consistently document your code in that style.
