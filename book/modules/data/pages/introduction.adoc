= Data

Data comes in so many different formats, and each format has its own set of rules and tooling surrounding it. Here, we've curated a list of formats that we think every data scientist should have at least a cursory exposure to. 

Do you have another data format that you think should be included? Please feel free to xref:book:ROOT:how-to-contribute.adoc[make a contribution]. See a mistake? Please https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/issues[open an issue] and we will get to it as soon as possible.
