= STAT 39000: Project 7 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Python is an incredible language that enables users to write code quickly and efficiently. When using Python to write code, you are _typically_ making a tradeoff between developer speed (the time in which it takes to write a functioning program or scripts) and program speed (how fast your code runs). This is often the best choice depending on your staff and how much your software developers or data scientists earn. However, Python code does _not_ have the advantage of being able to be compiled to machine code for a certain architecture (x86_64, ARM, Darwin, etc.), and easily shared. In Python you need to learn how to use virtual environments (and git) to share your code.

**Context:** This is the second in a series of 3 projects that explores how to setup and use virtual environments, as well as some `git` basics. This series is not intended to teach you everything you need to know, but rather to give you some exposure so the terminology and general ideas are not foreign to you. 

**Scope:** Python, virtual environments, git

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain what a virtual environment is and why it is important.
- Create, update, and use a virtual environment to run somebody else's Python code.
- Use git to create a repository and commit changes to it.
- Understand and utilize common `git` commands and workflows.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

In addition, the following is an illustration of the database to help you understand the data.

== Questions

[NOTE]
====
This will be another project light on code and data, which we will reintroduce in the next project. While the watch data is a pretty great dataset, I realize that perhaps its format is a distraction from the goal of the project, and not something you want to be fighting with as we being a series on using and writing APIs. We will begin to transition away from the watch data in this project, and instead use movie/tv-related data, which will be a _lot_ more fun to write an API for (hopefully).
====

=== Question 1

[CAUTION]
====
If you did not complete project (6), you should go back and complete question (1) and question (2) before continuing. Don't worry, you just need to follow the instructions, there is no critical thinking for those 2 questions. If you get stuck, just write in Piazza.
====

As alluded to in question (5) from the previous project, in this project, we will put to work what you learned from the previous project! 

First, if you haven't already, create a `firstname-lastname-project07.ipynb` file in your `$HOME` directory.

Review and read the content https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[here] on GitHub flow. GitHub flow is a workflow or pattern that you can follow that will help you work on the same codebase, with many others, at the same time. You may see where this is going, and it is a little crazy, but let's give this a try and see what happens.

In this project, we will be "collaborating" with every other 39000 student, but mostly with me. Normally, you would all have explicit permissions in GitHub to work on and collaborate on the repositories in a given organization. For example, if I added you all to TheDataMine GitHub organization, you could simply clone the repository, create your own branch, make modifications, and push the branch up to GitHub. Unfortunately, since _technically_ you aren't in TheDataMine GitHub organization, you can't do that. Instead, you need to _fork_ our repository, clone your fork of the repository, create your own branch, make modifications, and push the branch up to GitHub. Just follow the instructions provided and it will be fine!

Start by forking our repository. In a browser, navigate to https://github.com/TheDataMine/f2021-stat39000-project7, and in the upper right-hand corner, click the "Fork" button. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you are logged in to GitHub before you fork the repository!
====

image::figure15.webp[Fork the repository, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Fork the repository"]

This will create a _fork_ of our original repository in _your_ GitHub account. Now, we want to clone _your_ fork of the repo!

Clone your fork into your `$HOME` directory:

- YourUserName/f2021-stat39000-project7

[IMPORTANT]
====
Replace "YourUserName" with your GitHub username.
====

[NOTE]
====
Sometimes, repositories will be shown as GitHubOrgName/RepositoryName or GitHubUserName/RepositoryName. The repos will be located at https://github.com/GitHubOrgName/RepositoryName and https://github.com/GitHubUserName/RepositoryName, respectively. When using SSH (which we are) to clone those repos, the strings would be git@github.com:GitHubOrgName/RepositoryName.git and git@github.com:GitHubUserName/RepositoryName.git, respectively.

What does SSH vs HTTPS mean? Read https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories[here] for more information. When cloning a repo using HTTPS, it will look something like:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
----

When cloning a repo using SSH, it will look something like:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git
----

Both work fine, but I've had fewer issues with the latter, so that is what we will stick to for now.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to run the clone command in a bash cell in your `firstname-lastname-project07.ipynb` file.
====

[NOTE]
====
The result of cloning the repository will be a directory called `f2021-stat39000-project7` in your `$HOME` directory. Due to the nature of this project, your cloned repo may contain other students' code, if their code has been merged into the `main` branch -- cool!
====

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 2

Let's test things out to make sure they are working the way we intended. First, we can see that there is a `pyproject.toml` file and a `poetry.lock` file. Let's use poetry to build our virtual environment to run and test our code.

In a bash cell in your notebook, run the following:

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

module unload python/f2021-s2022-py3.9.6
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7
poetry install
----

[NOTE]
====
Recall that the `module unload` command is only needed due to the way we have things configured on Brown -- _typically_ it would be much more straightforward, and we would just run `poetry install`.
====

Great! Now, in the next bash cell, test out things by running the `runme.py` script.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

# unload the module
module unload python/f2021-s2022-py3.9.6

# give execute permissions to the runme.py script
chmod 700 $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7/scripts/runme.py

# navigate to inside the project directory (this is needed because your notebook is in your $HOME directory)
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7

# run the runme.py script using our environment
poetry run python scripts/runme.py
----

If all went well, you should see something **similar** to the following output.

.Output
----
Pandas is here!: /home/kamstut/f2021-stat39000-project7/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/__init__.py
^^^^^^^
If that doesnt start with something like "$HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7/.venv/..., you did something wrong
IMDB data from: /depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
8.2

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 3

Okay, great! So far, so good.

As a very important contributor to our new package, you will be adding a method to our `IMDB` class. This method should use the `aiosql` package to run a query (or more than one query) against the `imdb.db` database, and return some data or do something cool. As an alternative, your method could also do some sort of web scraping for IMDB. Your new method _must_ include a Google style docstring, and _must_ be non-trivial -- for example a method that returns the rating of a title or the name of a title is too simple. Any valid effort will be awarded full credit. 

[WARNING]
====
Before continuing, let's follow the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[first step] of the GitHub flow, and create our own branch to work on and commit changes to. Create a new branch called `firstname-lastname` from the `main` branch. Once created, _checkout_ the branch so it is your active branch.
====

[WARNING]
====
Remember that the `git` commands should be run _inside_ the project folder, `$HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7`. Since our Jupyter notebook, `firstname-lastname-project07.ipynb`, is in the `$HOME` directory, we need to `cd` into the project directory before we can run the `git` commands, for **every** bash cell in our notebook (except for the bash cell where we are cloning the repository). To make it explicitly clear, every bash cell in your notebook that isn't cloning the repo should have:

[source,bash]
----
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7
----

_Before_ you run the `git` commands.
====

Please take a look at the `get_rating` method in the `imdb.py` module for an example of a method. 

Please take a look at the `imdb_queries.sql` file, to see how a query is written using this package. https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql/defining-sql-queries.html[Here] is the official documentation for `aiosql`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that since we will _just_ be reading from the database, you will want to limit yourself to queries that are "Select One" (ending in a "^"), or "Select Value" (ending in a "$"), or "No Operator" (ending in no symbol).
====

Please take a look at `runme.py` to see how we used the `tdm_media` package.

To make these additions to the package you will need to:

. Modify the `imdb.py` module to add the new method.
+
[WARNING]
====
For simplicity, call your new method `firstname_lastname` in the `imdb.py` module. Where you would replace `firstname` and `lastname` with your first and last name, respectively.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to have examples of `title_id` values and `person_id` values, look no further than https://imdb.com! For example, let's say I want Peter Dinklage's person_id -- to get this, all I have to do is search for him on the IMDB website. I will be sent to a link similar to the following.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0227759

Here, you can see Peter Dinklage's person_id in the URL itself! It is "nm0227759".

Same for title_ids -- simply search for the movie or tv show or tv show episode you are curious about, and the `title_id` will be right in the URL.
====
. Modify the `imdb_queries.sql` file to add any new queries you need in order to get your `firstname_lastname` method working. 
+
[WARNING]
====
For simplicity, call your new queries `firstname_lastname_XX` in the `imdb_queries.sql` file. Where you would replace `firstname` and `lastname` with your first and last name, respectively, and you would replace `XX` with a counter like `01`, `02`, etc.

For example, if I had two queries my additions would look something like this:

.imdb_queries.sql
[source,sql]
----
-- name: kevin_amstutz_01$
-- Get the rating of the movie/tv episode/short with the given id
SELECT rating FROM ratings WHERE title_id = :title_id;

-- name: kevin_amstutz_02$
-- Get the rating of the movie/tv episode/short with the given id
SELECT rating FROM ratings WHERE title_id = :title_id;
----
====
+
. Create a new script in the scripts directory called `firstname_lastname.py`.
+
[TIP]
====
The following is some boilerplate code for your `firstname_lastname.py` script.

[source,python]
----
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]))

from tdm_media.imdb import IMDB
import pandas as pd

def main():

    dat = IMDB("/depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db")

    # code to use your method here, for example:
    print(dat.get_rating("tt5180504"))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
----
====
+
. Finally, if your new method uses a library not already included in our environment, you will need to install it.
+
[TIP]
====
To add the library (if and only if it is needed):

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

module unload python/f2021-s2022-py3.9.6
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7
poetry add thedatamine
----

Replace "thedatamine" with the name of the package you need.
====

Great! Once you've made these modifications, in a bash cell, run your new script and see if the output is what you expect it to be!

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

# unload the module
module unload python/f2021-s2022-py3.9.6

# give execute permissions to the firstname_lastname.py script
chmod 700 $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7/scripts/firstname_lastname.py

# navigate to inside the project directory (this is needed because your notebook is in your $HOME directory)
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7

# run the firstname_lastname.py script using our environment
poetry run python scripts/firstname_lastname.py

=== Question 4

Fantastic! We have implemented our new things, and we are ready to continue with the GitHub flow!

In a bash cell, navigate to the root of the project directory, `$HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7`, and stage any new files you've created that you would like to commit.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7
git add .
----

Excellent! Now, _commit_ the new files and changes. Be sure to include a commit message that describes what you've done.

[TIP]
====
Using `git commit` requires having a message with your commit! To add a message, simply use the `-m` flag. So for example.

[source,bash]
----
git commit -m "This is my fantastic new function."
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Normally, you'd add and commit files and changes as you are writing the code. However, since this is all so new, we set this up so you just add and commit all at once.
====

The next step in the GitHub flow would be to open a pull request. First, before we do that, we have to _push_ the changes we've made locally, on Brown, to our _remote_ (GitHub). To do this, in a bash cell, run the following command:

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project7
git push --set-upstream origin firstname-lastname
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Replace firstname-lastname with your first and last name, respectively. It is the name of your branch you created in question (3).
====

Once run, if you navigate to your fork's GitHub page, https://github.com/YourUserName/f2021-stat39000-project7, you should be able to refresh the webpage and see your new branch in the dropdown menu for branches.

image::figure07.webp[Looking at the branches, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Looking at the branches"]

Awesome! Okay, now you are ready to open a pull request. A pull request needs to be opened in the browser. Navigate to the project page https://github.com/YourUserName/f2021-stat39000-project7, click on the "Pull requests" tab, then click on "New pull request". 

We want to create a pull request that merges your branch, `firstname-lastname`, into the `main` branch. Select your branch from the menu on the right side of the left arrow, and click "Create pull request".

image::figure08.webp[Selecting what to merge, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Selecting what to merge"]

image::figure09.webp[Screen when selected, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Screen when selected"]

Enter the important information in the boxes. Describe what your function does, and why you want to merge it into the main branch. Once satisfied, in a comment box, write something like "@kevinamstutz Could you please review this?".

image::figure10.webp[Filling out the pull request, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Filling out the pull request"]

Click "Create pull request", and you should see a screen similar to the following.

image::figure11.webp[Resulting screen, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Resulting screen"]

Write back and forth with me at least once, and when you are good to go, I will write back and merge the PR.

Take a screenshot of the final result, after the PR is merged. 

image::figure12.webp[Final result, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Final result"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If I do not respond back and merge fast enough, it is OK to take a screenshot of the non-merged pull request page -- you will receive full credit. Try to wait though! I'm usually pretty quick!
====

Upload the screenshot to your `$HOME` directory, and include them using a markdown cell.

[TIP]
====
To include the image in a markdown cell, do the following. The following assumes your image is called `myimage.png` and is located in your `$HOME` directory. It also assumes your notebook is in the `$HOME` directory.

[source,ipython]
----
![](./myimage.png)
----

Then, run the cell! Your image will appear.

=== Question 5 (optional, 0 pts)

You've now worked through the entire GitHub flow! That is really great! It definitely can take some time getting used to. If you have the time, and are feeling adventurous, and _excellent_ test of your skills would be to add something to this book! Clone this repository (git@github.com:TheDataMine/the-examples-book.git), add some content, and create a pull request!

You can add a UNIX, R, Python, or SQL example, no problem! At some point in time, I'll review your addition and you will be an official contributor to the book! Why not?
