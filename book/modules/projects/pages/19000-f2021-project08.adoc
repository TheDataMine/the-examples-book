= STAT 19000: Project 8 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** A key component to writing efficient code is writing functions. Functions allow us to repeat and reuse coding steps that we used previously, over and over again. If you find you are repeating code over and over, a function may be a good way to reduce lots of lines of code!

**Context:** We've been learning about and using functions all year! Now we are going to learn more about some of the terminology and components of a function, as you will certainly need to be able to write your own functions soon.

**Scope:** r, functions

Read the `interactions_subset.csv` into a data.frame called `interactions`. We have provided you with the function `get_probability_of_review` below. 

After reading in the data, run the code below, and add comments explaining what the function is doing at each step.

[source,r]
----
# A function that, given a string (userID) and a value (min_rating) returns a value (probability_of_reviewing).
get_probability_of_review <- function(interactions_dataset, userID, min_rating) {
        # FILL IN EXPLANATION HERE
        user_data <- subset(interactions_dataset, user_id == userID)
        
        # FILL IN EXPLANATION HERE
        read_user_data <- subset(user_data, is_read == 1)
        
        # FILL IN EXPLANATION HERE
        read_user_min_rating_data <- subset(read_user_data, rating >= min_rating)
        
        # FILL IN EXPLANATION HERE
        probability_of_reviewing <- mean(read_user_min_rating_data$is_reviewed)
        
        # Return the result
        return(probability_of_reviewing)
}

get_probability_of_review(interactions_dataset = interactions, userID = 5000, min_rating = 3)
----

Provide 1-2 sentences explaining overall what the function is doing and what arguments it requires.

[TIP]
====
You may want to use `fread` function from the library `data.table` to read in the data.
====

[source,r]
----
library(data.table)
interactions <- fread("/path/to/dataset")
----

[CAUTION]
====
Your kernel may crash! As it turns out, the `subset` function is not very memory efficient (never fully trust a function).  When you launch your Jupyter Lab session, if you use 3072 MB of memory, your kernel is likely to crash on this example.  If (instead) you use 5120 MB of memory when you launch your session, you should have sufficient memory to run these examples.

=== Question 2

We want people that use our function to be able to get results even if they don't provide a minimum rating value. 

Modify the function `get_probability_of_review` so `min_rating` has the default value of 0. Test your function as follows.

[source,r]
----
get_probability_of_review(interactions_dataset = interactions, userID = 5000)
----

Now, in R (and in most languages), you can provide the arguments out of order, as long as you provide the argument name on the left of the equals sign and the value on the right. For example the following will still work.

[source,r]
----
get_probability_of_review(userID = 5000, interactions_dataset = interactions)
----

In addition, you don't have to provide the argument names when you call the function, however, you _do_ have to place the arguments in order when you do.

[source,r]
----
get_probability_of_review(interactions, 5000)
----

Our function may not be the most efficient. However, we _can_ reduce the code a little bit! Modify our function so we only use the `subset` function once, rather than 3 times.

Test your modified function on userID 5000.  Do you get the same results as above?

Now, instead of using `subset`, just use regular old indexing in your function.  Do your results agree with both versions above?

Apply our function to the `interactions` dataset to get, for a sample of 10 users, the probability of reviewing books given that they liked the book.

Save this probability to a vector called `prob_review`.

To do so, determine a minimum rating (`min_rating`) value when calculating that probability. Provide 1-2 sentences explaining why you chose this value.

[TIP]
====
You can use the function `sample` to get a random sample of 10 users.
====
