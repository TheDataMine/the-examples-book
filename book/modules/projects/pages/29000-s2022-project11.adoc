= STAT 29000: Project 11 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** Data wrangling is the process of gathering, cleaning, structuring, and transforming data. Data wrangling is a big part in any data driven project, and sometimes can take a great deal of time. `tidyverse` is a great, but opinionated, suite of integrated packages to wrangle, tidy and visualize data. It is useful to gain some familiarity with this collection of packages, in case you run into a situation where these packages are needed -- you may even find that you enjoy using them!

**Context:** We have covered a few topics on the `tidyverse` packages, but there is a lot more to learn! We will continue our strong focus on the tidyverse (including ggplot) and data wrangling tasks. This is the second in a series of 5 projects focused around using `tidyverse` packages to solve data-driven problems.

**Scope:** R, tidyverse, ggplot

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use mutate, pivot, unite, filter, and arrange to wrangle data and solve data-driven problems.
- Combine different data using joins (left_join, right_join, semi_join, anti_join), and bind_rows.
- Group data and calculate aggregated statistics using group_by, mutate, summarize, and transform functions.
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings, in ggplot.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/beer/beers.csv`
- `/depot/datamine/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

== Questions


=== Question 1

++++
<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_v2y789fx?wid=_983291"></iframe>
++++

Let's pick up where we left in the previous project. Copy and paste your commands from questions 1 to 3 that result in our `beers_reviews` dataset.

Using the pipelines (remember, the `%>%`), combine the necessary parts of questions 2 and 3, removing the need to have an intermediate `reviews_summary` dataset. This is a great way to practice and get a better understanding of `tidyverse`. 

Your code should read the datasets, summarize the reviews data similarly to what you did in question 2, and combine the summarized dataset with the `beers` dataset. This should all be accomplished from a single chunk of "piped-together" code.

[TIP]
====
Feel free to remove the `reviews` dataset after we have the `beers_reviews` dataset.

rm(reviews)

[TIP]
====
If you want to update how you calculated your `beer_goodness_indicator` from the previous project, this would be a great time to do so!

=== Question 2

Are there any differences in terms of `abv` between beers that are available in specific seasons? 

[NOTE]
====
ABV refers to the alcohol by volume of a beer. The higher the ABV, the more alcohol is in the beer.
====

1. Filter the `beers_reviews` dataset to contain beers available only in a specific season (`Fall`, `Winter`, `Spring`, `Summer`).
+
[TIP]
====

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html[This] function will help you do this operation. 
====
+
2. Make a side-by-side boxplot comparing `abv` for each season `availability`.

3. Make sure to use the `labs` function to have nice x-axis label and y-axis label.
+
[TIP]
====
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html?q=labs#null[This] is more information on `labs`.
====

Use pipelines, resulting in a single chunk of "piped-together" code.

[TIP]
====
Use the `fill` argument to https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html[this] function to color your boxplots differently for each season.
====

Write 1-2 sentences comparing the beers in terms of `abv` between the specific seasons. Are the results surprising or did you expect them?

[TIP]
====
The `aes` part of many `ggplot` plots may be confusing at first. In a nutshell, `aes` is used to match x-axis and y-axis values to columns of data in the given dataset. You should read https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html[this] documentation and the examples carefully to better understand.

Modify your code from question 2 to:

1. Create a new variable `is_good` that is 1 or TRUE if `beer_goodness_indicator` is greater than 3.5, and 0 or FALSE otherwise.
2. _Facet_ your boxplot based on `is_good`. The resulting graphic should make it easy to compare the "good" vs "bad" beers for each season.
+
[TIP]
====
https://thedatamine.github.io/the-examples-book/r.html#r-facet_grid[`facet_grid`] and https://thedatamine.github.io/the-examples-book/r.html#r-facet_wrap[`facet_wrap`] are two other functions that can be a bit confusing at first. With that being said, they are incredible powerful and make creating really impressive graphics very straightforward.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to use piping `%>%` as well as layers (`+`) to create your final `ggplot` plot, using a single chunk of piped/layered code.
====

How do beers differ in terms of ABV and being considered good or not (based on our definition) for the different seasons? Write 1-2 sentences describing what you see based on the plots.

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- 1-2 sentences answering the question.
====

=== Question 4

Modify your code from question 3 to answer the question based on summary statistics instead of graphical displays.

Make sure you compare the ABV per season `availability` and `is_good` using `mean`, `median` and `sd`. Your final dataframe should have 8 rows and the following columns: `is_good`, `availability`, `mean_abv`, `median_abv`, `std_abv`. 

[TIP]
====
The following function will be useful for this question: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html[`filter`], https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html[`mutate`], https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html[`group_by`], https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html[`summarize`] (within summarize: `mean`, `median`, `sd`).

=== Question 5

In this question, we want to make comparison in terms of `ABV` and `beer_goodness_indicator` for US states. 

Feel free to use whichever data-driven method you desire to answer this question! You can take summary statistics, make a variety of plots, and even filter to compare specific US states -- you can even create new columns combining states (based on region, political affiliation, etc).

Write a question related to US states, ABV and our "beer_goodness_indicator". Use your data-driven method(s) to answer it (if only anecdotally).

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- Write 1-2 sentences explaining your question and data-driven method(s).
- Write 1-2 sentences answering your question.
