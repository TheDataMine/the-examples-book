= STAT 39000: Project 10 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** One of the primary ways to get and interact with data today is via APIs. APIs provide a way to access data and functionality from other applications. There are 3 very popular types of APIs that you will likely encounter in your work: RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, and gRPC APIs. We will address some pros and cons of each, with a focus on the most ubiquitous, RESTful APIs.

**Context:** This is the third in a series of 4 projects focused around APIs. We will learn some basics about interacting and using APIs, and even build our own API.

**Scope:** Python, APIs, requests, fastapi

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand and use the HTTP methods with the `requests` library.
- Differentiate between graphql, REST APIs, and gRPC.
- Write REST APIs using the `fastapi` library to deliver data and functionality to a client.
- Identify the various components of a URL. 
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Questions

=== Question 1

Begin this project by cloning our repo and installing the required packages. To do so, run the following in a bash cell.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This repository -- TheDataMine/f2021-stat39000-project10 -- is a refreshed version of project (9). We've added some more functionality, but that is about it. Since it contains the solutions to project (9), it will be released sometime on Saturday, November 6th, and at the latest, on Monday, November 8th. 

Until that time, you are more than welcome to use the solutions to your project (9) as a starting point for this project. 
====

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

cd $HOME
git clone git@github.com:TheDataMine/f2021-stat39000-project10.git
----

Then, to install the required packages, run the following in a bash cell.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

module unload python/f2021-s2022-py3.9.6
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project10
poetry install
----

Next, let's identify a port that we can run our API on. In a bash cell, run the following.

[source,ipython]
----
%%bash

port
----

You will get a port number, like the following, for example.

.Output
----
1728
----

From this point on, when we mention the port 1728, please replace it with the port number you were assigned. Open a new terminal tab so that we can run our API, alongside our notebook.

Next, you'll need to add a `.env` file to your `f2021-stat39000-project10` directory, with the following content. (Pretty much just like the previous project!)

----
DATABASE_PATH=/depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

In your terminal, run the following.

[source,bash]
----
module use /scratch/brown/kamstut/tdm/opt/modulefiles
module load poetry/1.1.10
cd $HOME/f2021-stat39000-project10
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 1728
----

Upon success, you should see some output similar to:

.Output
----
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['$HOME/f2021-stat39000-project9']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:1728 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [25005] using watchgod
INFO:     Started server process [25008]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
----

Fantastic! Leave that running in your terminal, and test it out with the following request in a regular Python cell in your notebook.

[source,python]
----
import requests
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/json'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728", headers=my_headers)
print(resp.json())
----

You should receive a Hello World message, great!

[TIP]
====
Throughout this project, be patient waiting for your requests to complete -- sometimes they take a while. If it is taking too long, you can always try killing the server. To do so, open the terminal tab and hold ctrl and press c. This will kill the server. Once killed, just restart it using the same command you used previously to start it.

Finally, there are now 2 places to check for errors and print statements: the terminal and the notebook. When you get an error be sure to check both for useful clues! 
====

[TIP]
====
Please test the requests in your notebook with the code we provide you. We've tested them and know that they work. If you choose to test them with a different movie/tv show/etc., you could get unexpected errors related to our `schemas.py` file -- best just to stick to the requests we provide.

=== Question 2

So you've written an API, now what? Well, while an API can have a variety of uses, one of the most common uses is as a _backend_ for a web application. Modern websites typically have a _frontend_ and  _backend_. The frontend makes _requests_ to the backend, and the backend responds with _data_ to the frontend. The frontend then displays the data. This architecture makes it easy for developers to work independently on frontend things and backend things without have to understand every detail of the other "side" of the application.

While frequently some sort of javascript framework is used for a frontend (things like reactjs, vuejs, angularjs, etc.), we can use Python and fastapi to create a super simple frontend! 

To get started, let's define something (just for clarity, these aren't real terms). Let's call a _backend_ request a request made with the `requests` package. This would be any request where we want the JSON formatted data as our response. Let's call a _frontend_ request a request made by a browser, or something similar. This would be any request where we want to use the data, but maybe display it using HTML, instead of JSON.

The following is an example of a _backend_ request.

[source,python]
----
import requests
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/json'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728", headers=my_headers)
print(resp.json())
----

.Output
----
{'hello_item': 'hello', 'world_item': 'world'}
----

The following is an example of a _frontend_ request.

[source,python]
----
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/html'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728", headers=my_headers)
display(HTML(resp.text))
----

Where the output will be formatted HTML -- just like you'd see in a browser.

[NOTE]
====
We _wanted_ you to be able to just type the URLs in a browser to see the results of our frontend requests, but unfortunately, this is the best we can do for now. We are emulating a frontend request by setting the accept head to `application/html`. This is a bit of a hack, but it works.
====

Okay, now, maybe you are asking yourself -- but the two requests have the same url, `http://localhost:1728`, why don't we get the same response for both?

The answer is that we are using the `accept` header to try and determine if the request is being made from a browser, or from something like the `requests` package. Check out the `root` function in the `main.py` module.

We first get the header from the `request` object:

[source,python]
----
accept = request.headers.get("accept")
----

If the header is `application/json`, then we know that the user wants to have JSON output, not HTML. If the header is `application/html`, or if the header has multiple values separated by commas, then we assume that the user is a browser or someone making a frontend request.

Why is any of this important? Well, wouldn't it be cool if we could type: `http://localhost:1728/movies/tt0076759` into a browser and get our data formatted into a webpage? But then, at the same time, use the exact same endpoint to get the data formatted as JSON, in case we wanted to use the API with some program we are writing? Thats what this trick allows us to do!

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this question, make sure to just run the "frontend" and "backend" requests in your notebook (provided above). Other than that, just try and do your best to understand what is happening in the `root` function. That's it!

=== Question 3

The goal of this question (and the following questions) use our templating engine/Python package called `jinja2` to render webpages for the requests we built in the previous project. To get you started, we've provided HTML templates in the `templates` directory. These templates currently just contain boilerplate HTML structure that you will add to so our data is rendered neatly(ish).

[IMPORTANT]
====
At this point in time you are probably feeling overwhelmed and not understanding what is going on -- that is okay, it will start to make more sense as you mess around with things. If it is any consolation -- you will **not** be writing _any_ Python code today! You'll just be using the `jinja2` package within our HTML templates. There is a small learning curve, but I will provide examples with the questions, so you can see the syntax.
====

Let's start with the following webpage:

- `http://localhost:1728/movies/{title_id}`

To make the "frontend" request, run the following in a cell.

[source,python]
----
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/html'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728/movies/tt0076759", headers=my_headers)
display(HTML(resp.text))
----

We've set the template up to provide you with an example of a loop (see the genres section in `movie.html`), and some examples of simple data access. There are some missing pieces of information we want you to add (information in the "Facts:" section)! Please add the missing fields to the HTML template, and make a new frontend request. The results should look like the following:

image::figure26.webp[Expected output for question 3, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Expected output for question 3"]

To remind yourself what the JSON response for this request looks like run the following in a cell.

[source,python]
----
import requests
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/json'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728/movies/tt0076759", headers=my_headers)
print(resp.json())
----

We pass the entire `Movie` object to `jinja2`, so everything you see in the JSON response, we can access and embed in the HTML template. Notice in the `main.py` file how we are returning a single `Title` object. If you look in `schemas.py`, you can see all of the attributes of the `Title` object that you can access using dot notation. The variable itself, is named `movie` since the object we return in the `get_movies` function in `main.py` is named `movie`. So, in our template, we can access the primary title, for example using `movie.primary_title`. We can also access any other variable that exists in the `Title` class shown in `schemas.py` in the same way!

=== Question 4

Let's say that we only like movies that premiered after 1990 (inclusive). Any other movie, we want to make the `h1` header bright red for "not going to watch _that_". Could we do that? Yes!

[TIP]
====
To change the text color of an `h1` element, see https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp[this link].
====

Update the `movie.html` template to do this. Check out the examples https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/#if[here].

To test your work, run the following two chunks of code. The first should display in red, the second should not.

[source,python]
----
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/html'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728/movies/tt0076759", headers=my_headers)
display(HTML(resp.text))
----

[source,python]
----
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/html'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728/movies/tt7401588", headers=my_headers)
display(HTML(resp.text))
----

=== Question 5

Okay, great! Now we have a cool page for any movie we want to look up. Read about HTML tables https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp[here].

Modify the `episodes.html` template in the `templates` directory to display the following information in a neatly formatted table _with_ a header row: `title_id`, `primary_title`, `is_adult`, `premiered`, and `runtime_minutes`.

Rather than displaying `True` or `False` for the `is_adult` field, instead display the text `Yes` or `No`.

[TIP]
====
Use conditionals in `jinja2` to display the text `Yes` or `No` for the `is_adult` field.
====

[TIP]
====
Check out the `get_episodes` function in `main.py` to see how we are returning a list of `Title` objects (that represent episodes). Note that the _name_ of the variable sent to the template is `episodes`, which is a _list_ of episodes. Use the name `episodes` in your template to access the data.
====

[TIP]
====
Remember, while working in your template, `episodes.html`, you can access the _list_ of `Title` objects using the name `episodes`. With that being said, **be careful** -- you don't want to try `episodes.primary_title` or `episodes.is_adult`, because that will try to access the `primary_title` and `is_adult` fields of the `Title` object, which you don't want to do, because `episodes` is a **list** of `Title` objects, not a single `Title` object. 

Therefore, you should use a loop to access each individual `Title` object in the `episodes` list.
====

To take a look at the list of `Title` objects returned by the `get_episodes` function, in JSON format, run the following in a cell.

[source,python]
----
import requests
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/json'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728/tv/tt1475582/seasons/1/episodes", headers=my_headers)
print(resp.json())
----

To test your work, run the following in a cell.

[source,python]
----
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
my_headers = {'accept': 'application/html'}
resp = requests.get("http://localhost:1728/tv/tt1475582/seasons/1/episodes", headers=my_headers)
display(HTML(resp.text))
----

The output should look like the following:
