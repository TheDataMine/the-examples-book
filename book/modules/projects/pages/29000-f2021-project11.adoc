= STAT 29000: Project 11 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Being able to use results of queries as tables in new queries (also known as writing sub-queries), and calculating values like `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` in aggregate are key skills to have in order to write more complex queries. In this project we will learn about aliasing, writing sub-queries, and calculating aggregate values.

**Context:** We are in the middle of a series of projects focused on working with databases and SQL. In this project we introduce aliasing, sub-queries, and calculating aggregate values!

**Scope:** SQL, SQL in R

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to interact with popular database management systems within R.
- Solve data-driven problems using a combination of SQL and R.
- Basic clauses: SELECT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DESC, ASC, COUNT, WHERE, FROM, etc.
- Showcase the ability to filter, alias, and write subqueries.
- Perform grouping and aggregate data using group by and the following functions: COUNT, MAX, SUM, AVG, LIKE, HAVING. Explain when to use having, and when to use where.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db`

In addition, the following is an illustration of the database to help you understand the data.

image::figure14.webp[Database diagram from https://dbdiagram.io, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Database diagram from https://dbdiagram.io"]

For this project, we will be using the imdb sqlite database. This database contains the data in the directory listed above.

To run SQL queries in a Jupyter Lab notebook, first run the following in a cell at the top of your notebook.

[source,ipython]
----
%load_ext sql
%sql sqlite:////depot/datamine/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

The first command loads the sql extension. The second command connects to the database.

For every following cell where you want to run a SQL query, prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- just like we do for R or bash cells.

== Questions

=== Question 1

Let's say we are interested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). We could write the following query to get the titles of all the movies in the MCU (at least, available in our database).

[source, sql]
----
SELECT premiered, COUNT(*) FROM titles WHERE title_id IN ('tt0371746', 'tt0800080', 'tt1228705', 'tt0800369', 'tt0458339', 'tt0848228', 'tt1300854', 'tt1981115', 'tt1843866', 'tt2015381', 'tt2395427', 'tt0478970', 'tt3498820', 'tt1211837', 'tt3896198', 'tt2250912', 'tt3501632', 'tt1825683', 'tt4154756', 'tt5095030', 'tt4154664', 'tt4154796', 'tt6320628', 'tt3480822', 'tt9032400', 'tt9376612', 'tt9419884', 'tt10648342', 'tt9114286') GROUP BY premiered;
----

The result would be a perfectly good-looking table. Now, with that being said, are the headers good-looking? I don't know about you, but `COUNT(*)` as a header is pretty bad looking. xref:book:SQL:aliasing.adoc[Aliasing] is a great way to not only make the headers look good, but it can also be used to reduce the text in a query by giving some intermediate results a shorter name.

Fix the query so that the headers are `year` and `movie count`, respectively.

Okay, let's say we are interested in modifying our query from question (1) to get the _percentage_ of MCU movies released in each year. Essentially, we want the count for each group, divided by the total count of all the movies in the MCU.

We can achieve this using a _subquery_. A subquery is a query that is used to get a smaller result set from a larger result set. 

Write a query that returns the total count of the movies in the MCU, and then use it as a subquery to get the percentage of MCU movies released in each year.

[TIP]
====
You do _not_ need to change the query from question (1), rather, you just need to _add_ to the query.
====

[TIP]
====
You can directly divide `COUNT(*)` from the original query by the subquery to get the result!
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your initial result may seem _very_ wrong (no fractions at all!) this is OK -- we will fix this in the next question.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use aliasing to rename the new column to `percentage`.

Okay, if you did question (2) correctly, you should have got a result that looks a lot like: 

.Output
----
year,movie count,percentage
2008, 2, 0
2010, 1, 0
2011, 2, 0
...
----

What is going on?

The `AS` keyword can _also_ be used to _cast_ types. Some of you may or may not be familiar with a feature of many programming languages. Common in many programming languages is an "integer" type -- which is for numeric data _without_ a decimal place, and a "float" type -- which is for numeric data _with_ a decimal place. In _many_ languages, if you were to do the following, you'd get what _may_ be unexpected output.

[source,c]
----
9/4
----

.Output
----
2
----

Since both of the values are integers, the result will truncate the decimal place. In other words, the result will be 2, instead of 2.25.

In Python, they've made changes so this doesn't happen.

[source,python]
----
9/4
----

.Output
----
2.25
----

However, if we want the "regular" functionality we can use the `//` operator.

[source,python]
----
9//4
----

.Output
----
2
----

Okay, sqlite does this as well.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT 9/4 as result;
----

.Output
----
result
2
----

_This_ is why we are getting 0's for the percentage column!

How do we fix this? The following is an example.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT CAST(9 AS real)/4 as result;
----

.Output
----
result
2.25
----

[NOTE]
====
Here, "real" represents "float" or "double" -- it is another way of saying a number with a decimal place.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you do arithmetic with an integer and a real/float, the result will be a real/float.
====

Fix the query so that the results look something like:

.Output
----
year, movie count, percentage
2008, 2, 0.0689...
2010, 1, 0.034482...
2011, 2, 0.0689...

You now know 2 different applications of the `AS` keyword, and you also know how to use a query as a subquery, great!

In the previous project, we were introduced to aggregate functions. We used the GROUP BY clause to group our results by the `premiered` column in this project too! We know we can use the `WHERE` clause to filter our results, but what if we wanted to filter our results based on an aggregated column?

Modify our query from question (3) to print only the rows where the `movie count` is greater than 2.

[TIP]
====

Write a query that returns the average number of words in the `primary_title` column, by year, and only for years where the average number of words in the `primary_title` is less than 3.

Look at the results. Which year had the lowest average number of words in the `primary_title` column (no need to write another query for this, just eyeball it)?

[TIP]
====
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3293790/query-to-count-words-sqlite-3[here]. Replace "@String" with the column you want to count the words in.
====

[TIP]
====
If you got it right, there should be 15 rows in the output.
