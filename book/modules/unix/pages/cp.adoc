= cp

`cp` is a utility used for copying files and folder from one location to another. There are 3 primary ways to use `cp`. How `cp` functions varies depending on the type and number of arguments passed to it.

. **Arguments are both filenames:**
+
When both arguments are filenames, `cp` copies the file at the first argument to the file at the second argument. 
+
[source,bash]
----
cp /home/kamstut/myfile.txt /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/myfile_copied.txt
----
+ 
Here, `/home/kamstut/myfile.txt` is the source file and `/home/kamstut/projects/project_1/myfile_copied.txt` is the destination file. If `/home/kamstut/projects/project_1/myfile_copied.txt` already exists, `cp` will overwrite it, without warning. If it does _not_ already exist, a new file will be created, and the content copied over.
+
[NOTE]
====
`cp` accepts _relative_ paths as arguments, as well as _absolute_ paths.
====
+
. **Copying directories:**
+
In order to copy folders using `cp`, we must use the `-R` option. When both arguments are directories, `cp` copies the directory in the first argument to the directory at the second argument.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -R /home/kamstut/other_files /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/
----
+
Here, the `other_files` folder is copied (with its contents) to `/home/kamstut/projects/project_1/other_files`. In order to copy the _contents_ of the `other_files` folder, we must use a wildcard.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -R /home/kamstut/other_files/* /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/
----
Here, all files in the `other_files` folder are copied to `/home/kamstut/projects/project_1/`. In fact, in this situation, you do not even need to have the `-R` option.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp /home/kamstut/other_files/* /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/
----
+
. **Two or more arguments:**
+ 
When two or more arguments are passed to `cp`, `cp` copies every file specified to the destination specified. The destination is the last argument. 
+
[source,bash]
----
cp /home/kamstut/myfile1.txt /home/kamstut/myfile2.txt /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/
----
+
Here, `myfile1.txt` and `myfile2.txt` are copied to the desination `/home/kamstut/projects/project_1/`.
+
If we wanted to copy a _directory_ to our destination as well, we would need to add the `-R` flag.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -R /home/kamstut/myfile1.txt /home/kamstut/myfile2.txt /home/kamstut/other_files /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/
----
+
Here, `myfile1.txt`, `myfile2.txt` and the `other_files` folder are all copied to the destination `/home/kamstut/projects/project_1/`.
+
If we wanted to copy `myfile1.txt`, `myfile2.txt`, and the _contents_ of the `other_files` to the same destination, we would need to use a wildcard, `*` to indicate we want to copy the _files_ in `other_files`.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -R /home/kamstut/myfile1.txt /home/kamstut/myfile2.txt /home/kamstut/other_files/* /home/kamstut/projects/project_1/
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The last argument _must_ be a directory.
