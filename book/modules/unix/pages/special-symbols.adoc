== . & ..

You may have noticed a couple of oddities when running `ls -la`. Specifically, you may have noticed that `.` and `..` are listed in the output. 

`.` represents the directory you are currently in, or, if it is a part of a path, it means "this directory". For example, if you are in the `/depot/datamine/data` directory, and run `ls -la`, you will see the following.

The `.` in this context means the directory `/depot/datamine/data`. If you run the following bash command, the `.` is redundant and refers to the `/depot/datamine/data` directory.

[source,bash]
----
ls -la /depot/datamine/data/.
----

The `..` represents the _parent_ directory, relative to the rest of the path. The parent directory is the directory that _contains_ the directory you are currently in. For example, if you are in `/depot/datamine/data/yelp`, the _parent_ directory is `/depot/datamine/data`. 

`..` is extremely useful. You can use it with any command line utility, for example, xref:book:unix:ls.adoc[`ls`].

[source,bash]
----
# this will list the contents of the parent directory
ls -la ..
----

Any path that contains either `.` or `..` is considered a _relative path_. Any path that contains the path, in its entirety, starting from the root directory, `/`, is considered an _absolute path_.

For example, if we are currently in the `/depot/datamine/data/yelp` directory, a _relative_ path to `/depot/datamine/data` is simply `..`, whereas the _absolute_ path is `/depot/datamine/data`.

== ~

`~` represents the location which is in the `$HOME` xref:book:unix:environment-variables.adoc[environment variable]. If you change `$HOME`, `~` will also change.

`~` can be used just like `.` or `..`, for example, to change to your home directory, all 3 of the following commands will work.

[source,bash]
----
cd ~
cd $HOME
cd 
----

In addition to representing the current user's `$HOME` directory, `~` can be combined with another user's username to represent that user's `$HOME` directory. For example, if my username is `kamstut`, and I want to references a path in Dr. Ward's `$HOME` directory, and Dr. Wards username is `mdw`, I can use `~mdw` to represent his `$HOME` directory, `/home/mdw`.

[source,bash]
----
echo ~ # /home/kamstut
echo ~kamstut # /home/kamstut
echo ~mdw # /home/mdw
echo ~mdw/projects # /home/mdw/projects
----

As you are navigating directories, to jump to the most previously visited directory, you can run `~-`. For example, if you navigate to `/home/$USER/projects/project1/output`, then to `/home/$USER`, and you'd like to jump directly back to `/home/$USER/projects/project1/output`, you can run `~-`. `~-` is simply a reference to the location stored in the xref:book:unix:environment-variables.adoc[environment variable] `$OLDPWD`.

[source,bash]
----
pwd # /home/kamstut
cd /home/kamstut/projects/project1/output
pwd # /home/kamstut/projects/project1/output
cd ~
pwd # /home/kamstut
cd ~- 
pwd # /home/kamstut/projects/project1/output
