= `ls`

`ls` (think _list_) is one of the most-used commands in Unix-like operating systems. `ls` prints the files and sub-directories located in the current working directory, or, in the directory specified as an argument by the user. 

`ls` is incredibly useful for navigation. When working with a graphical user interface (GUI), like Finder in MacOS or File Explorer in Windows, the files and folders in a directory are shown to you each time you navigate to and from a specific directory. 

When navigating files and folders via a shell, this is not quite as straightforward. When using xref:book:unix:cd.adoc[`cd`] to navigate to a particular directory, you will _not_ have a nice list of files and folders presented to you upon navigating to said directory. Instead, we use `ls` to _list_ the files and folders, and see what options we have for navigation. For example, let's say our current working directory is `/home/john/`, and we want to go to our projects folder (`/home/john/projects`) to see what projects we have. To navigate to our projects folder, we can use `cd`.

[source,bash]
----
cd projects
----

Unfortunately, `cd` will simply change your current working directory, and that is _all_ that will happen. How do you know what projects reside in our projects folder? Well, we can use `ls` to list the files and folders in our projects folder.

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

.Output
----
project_1   project_2
project_3   project_4
readme.txt  
----

Now, we know we can use `cd` to navigate to any of the following project folders: `project_1`, `project_2`, `project_3`, and `project_4`. Let's navigate to our `project_1` folder, and list the files and folders in our `project_1` folder.

[source, bash]
----
cd project_1
ls
----

This would result in an output that looks something like this.

----
schedule.pdf    code.py     STAT_190    MA_165 
----

Here you can see that there are two files, and two sub-directories located in the `project_1` directory. From here, you can `cd` into the `STAT_190` or the `MA_165` sub-directory.

`ls` and `cd` are often used hand-in-hand. This makes sense: it is unlikely that you will remember the files located in each directory and sub-directory when navigating in the terminal.

== options

Like most unix utilities, there are many options that are used with `ls`. The following is an example of using `ls` with the `-a` option.

[source, bash]
----
ls -a
----

Here are a few, and what they do!

* `-a`: list all files, including hidden files.
* `-l`: outputs the files in the directory in a list format.
* `-S`: sorts the output by the size of each file (please note that this is a *capital* S).
* `-h`: stands for "human-readable" and outputs the size of each file in a human-readable format.

Multiple options can be given 1-by-1, like in the following example.

[source,bash]
----
ls -a -l

# order of options does not matter
ls -l -a
----

Or, rather than providing a new dash for each option, you can "smash" every option together.

[source,bash]
----
ls -la

# order still doesn't matter
ls -al
----
