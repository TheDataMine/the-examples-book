= touch

`touch` is a utility designed for updating the access and modifications times of one or more files. More commonly, however, it is used to simply create a blank file.

To use touch to create an empty file, simply run `touch` followed by the absolute, or relative path to the file you wish to create.

[source,bash]
----
touch /home/kamstut/test.txt
----

Just like that, an empty file called `test.txt` will be created in the `/home/kamstut` directory.

The _actual_ purpose of this utility is to change the access and modification times of a given file. By default, if you use `touch` to create a new file, the new file will be created with the current time as its access and modification times.

[source,bash]
----
touch /home/kamstut/test.txt
stat /home/kamstut/test.txt
----

.Output
----
  File: ‘test.txt’
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 524288 regular empty file

Here, you can see that `test.txt` was created on August 31, 2021 at 13:37:42.225731000, and the access and modification times were set to the current time. You can even see what time zone the system is in.

To modify the modification time, and _only_ the modification time, use the `-m` option. By default, this will change the modification time to the current time.

[source,bash]
----
touch -m /home/kamstut/test.txt
stat /home/kamstut/test.txt
----

.Output

To change the modification time to a time _other than_ the current time, use the `-t` option.

[source,bash]
----
touch -m -t "201908311401.45" /home/kamstut/test.txt
stat /home/kamstut/test.txt
----

.Output

To change _only_ the access time, similarly to the `-m` option, use the `-a` option. By default, with no `-a` option and no `-m` option, both the access and modification times will be set to the current time.

Lastly, to change an access and/or modification time to match another file's values, use the `-r` option.

[source,bash]
----
touch /home/kamstut/test2.txt
stat /home/kamstut/test2.txt
----

.Output
----
  File: ‘test2.txt’
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 524288 regular empty file

Now to change our new `test2.txt` file to match the same access and modification times as our original `test.txt` file, we can use the `-r` option.

[source,bash]
----
touch /home/kamstut/test2.txt -r /home/kamstut/test.txt
----

.Output
