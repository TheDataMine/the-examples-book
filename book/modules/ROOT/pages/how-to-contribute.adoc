== Adding content

If you are interested in making a contribution to this book, the first step is to xref:git:github-desktop.adoc#install-github-desktop[install and configure GitHub Desktop]. Then, use the quick-start links provided below.

- <<adding-an-example, Adding an example>>
- <<adding-a-page, Adding a page>>
- <<adding-a-module, Adding a module>>
- <<adding-an-appendix, Adding an appendix>>
- <<designing-for-accessibility, Designing for accessibility>>

To learn more about how the book is organized, see <<organization, our organization section>>. To learn about and see some AsciiDoc examples, see <<asciidoc, our AsciiDoc section>>.

=== Adding an example

This example assumes:

. the-examples-book repository is located on your local machine at `/Users/myusername/projects/the-examples-book`.
. You've xref:git:github-desktop.adoc#install-github-desktop[installed and configured GitHub Desktop], and your **Current Repository** (in the upper left-hand corner) is set to the-examples-book. Your screen should look similar to the following.

image::figure04.webp[GitHub Desktop, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="GitHub Desktop screen"]

We want to add the following Python example to the Python module.

[source,python]
----
include::example$example03.py[]
----

. First, create a new branch from the "main" branch describing what you are doing, for example, "add-example-reading-data". To do this, click on the middle tab in GitHub Desktop which will show your current branch. Switch branches to the "main" branch. Once complete, click on the middle tab again, and click the btn:[New Branch] button.
+
image::figure11.webp[Click the New Branch button, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Click the New Branch button"]
+
. You will be presented with a field and description. Ensure that you are creating a branch from the "main" branch. Enter the new branch name in the text area.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Branch names must be unique, and not already exist.
+
image::figure12.webp[Create the new branch, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Name and create the new branch"]
+
. Next, look at the current structure of the book and determine which module the example belongs in. In this case, this is a Python example, and therefore most likely belongs in the Python module.
. Next, create a new file with the code of the example, and place this file in the examples directory in the python directory. We can see that there is already a `python/examples/example01.py` file, so let's call our example `example02.py`.
. If we have already determined we are just adding an example (vs. a page, or module), it is likely that there is already a page where this example fits appropriately. In this case, this is an example of ready a semi-colon separated file using `pandas`. Looking in the Python module, we can see that the `pandas-read-write-data.adoc` page is where this example belongs. Open the document in your favorite text editor, and add the following content in the **Examples** section of the page.
+
[source, asciidoc]
....
==== How do I read a csv file called `grades_semi.csv` into a `pandas` DataFrame, where `grades_semi.csv` is semi-colon-separated instead of comma-separated?

.Solution
====
[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd

myDF = pd.read_csv("./grades_semi.csv", sep=";")
myDF.head()

....
+
. Upon saving the document, you will see that GitHub Desktop shows the added content in our `pandas-read-write-data.adoc` page. This addition is _staged_.
+
image::figure05.webp[Staged change in GitHub Desktop, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Staged change in GitHub Desktop"]
+
. The next step is _commit_ the changes. Check the files you'd like to commit in the left-hand section of GitHub Desktop. In the lower left-hand section of GitHub Desktop, create a descriptive commit message, for example, "Add an example reading in semi-colon-separated data in Python". In the larger text area, you can add any other important details. 
+
[NOTE]
All text entered in the description section is Markdown friendly -- feel free to use bullets or headers.
+
image::figure06.webp[Changes ready to commit, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Changes ready to commit"]
+
. Once the changes are committed, and you are ready to incorporate these changes to the book, the next step is to publish (or _push_) this branch to our _remote_ repository (hosted on GitHub). 
+
image::figure07.webp[Branch ready to publish, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Branch ready to publish"]
+
. Click btn:[Publish branch]. You should see a screen indicating the branch is being published.
+
image::figure08.webp[Publishing branch, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Publishing branch"]
+
. Once published, your branch will be available to everyone using GitHub. In order to incorporate the changes in this branch to the "main" branch, we must create a _pull request_ or _merge request_. Click the blue btn:[Create Pull Request] button.
+
image::figure09.webp[Create pull request, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Click Create Pull Request"]
+
. This will launch you browser and present you with the following screen. On this screen, you can (and should) assign a reviewer (the individual responsible for reviewing the content), designate an assignee (the individual who will actually merge the content), assign a label, and add any further comments. 
+
image::figure10.webp[Open pull request, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Open pull request"]
+
At this stage, you are done. All you need to do is respond to any follow up questions by the assignee or reviewer (which you will get emailed if/when this happens).
+
In time, your content will be reviewed, and merged. Once merged, it is a matter of waiting ~5 minutes until the book is compiled, deployed, and the search index is updated. Congratulations, and thank you!

=== Adding a page

This example assumes:

. the-examples-book repository is located on your local machine at `/Users/myusername/projects/the-examples-book`.
. You've xref:git:github-desktop.adoc#install-github-desktop[installed and configured GitHub Desktop], and your **Current Repository** (in the upper left-hand corner) is set to the-examples-book. Your screen should look similar to the following.

image::figure04.webp[GitHub Desktop, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="GitHub Desktop screen"]

We notice there isn't any content on `pandas` DataFrame's, and we think that info would fit nicely into a separate page.

. First, create a new branch from the "main" branch describing what you are doing, for example, "add-pd-dataframe-page". To do this, click on the middle tab in GitHub Desktop which will show your current branch. Switch branches to the "main" branch. Once complete, click on the middle tab again, and click the btn:[New Branch] button.
+
image::figure11.webp[Click the New Branch button, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Click the New Branch button"]
+
. You will be presented with a field and description. Ensure that you are creating a branch from the "main" branch. Enter the new branch name in the text area.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Branch names must be unique, and not already exist.
+
image::figure12.webp[Create the new branch, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Name and create the new branch"]
+
. Next, look at the current structure of the book and determine which module the new page belongs in. In this case, this is a Python specific page, and therefore belongs in the Python module.
. Next, create a new file in the Python module's "pages" directory called `pandas-dataframes.adoc`. Add the following content to the new page.
+
[source, asciidoc]
....
= DataFrames

Some content.

== `some_function or method`

`some_function or method` description.

=== Examples

==== Question text

=== Resources
....
+
[NOTE]
This structure is appropriate for most pages in the book. If you are creating a page that doesn't fit this format, do your best and changes may be suggested in the review process.
+
. Make any other additions or changes you'd like to make to the contents of the new page, and save. 
. Open up the module's `nav.adoc` file and add navigation to the new page. In this example, the following would be an appropriate _before_ and _after_ for `nav.adoc`.
+
.Before
[source, asciidoc]
....
* xref:introduction.adoc[Python]
** xref:pandas-intro.adoc[pandas]
*** xref:pandas-read-write-data.adoc[Reading & Writing Data] 
....
+ 
.After
[source, asciidoc]
....
* xref:introduction.adoc[Python]
** xref:pandas-intro.adoc[pandas]
*** xref:pandas-read-write-data.adoc[Reading & Writing Data] 
*** xref:pandas-dataframes.adoc[DataFrames]
....
+
[TIP]
You can nest pages however you'd like -- although it is best to keep it well organized. You can read more about navigation using Antora https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/navigation/files-and-lists/[here].
+
. Upon saving the document, you will see that GitHub Desktop shows the added content in our `pandas-read-write-data.adoc` page. This addition is _staged_.
+
image::figure05.webp[Staged change in GitHub Desktop, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Staged change in GitHub Desktop"]
+
. The next step is _commit_ the changes. Check the files you'd like to commit in the left-hand section of GitHub Desktop. In the lower left-hand section of GitHub Desktop, create a descriptive commit message, for example, "Add a page that covers `pandas` DataFrame's". In the larger text area, you can add any other important details. 
+
[NOTE]
All text entered in the description section is Markdown friendly -- feel free to use bullets or headers.
+
image::figure06.webp[Changes ready to commit, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Changes ready to commit"]
+
. Once the changes are committed, and you are ready to incorporate these changes to the book, the next step is to publish (or _push_) this branch to our _remote_ repository (hosted on GitHub). 
+
image::figure07.webp[Branch ready to publish, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Branch ready to publish"]
+
. Click btn:[Publish branch]. You should see a screen indicating the branch is being published.
+
image::figure08.webp[Publishing branch, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Publishing branch"]
+
. Once published, your branch will be available to everyone using GitHub. In order to incorporate the changes in this branch to the "main" branch, we must create a _pull request_ or _merge request_. Click the blue btn:[Create Pull Request] button.
+
image::figure09.webp[Create pull request, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Click Create Pull Request"]
+
. This will launch you browser and present you with the following screen. On this screen, you can (and should) assign a reviewer (the individual responsible for reviewing the content), designate an assignee (the individual who will actually merge the content), assign a label, and add any further comments. 
+
image::figure10.webp[Open pull request, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Open pull request"]
+
At this stage, you are done. All you need to do is respond to any follow up questions by the assignee or reviewer (which you will get emailed if/when this happens).
+
In time, your content will be reviewed, and merged. Once merged, it is a matter of waiting ~5 minutes until the book is compiled, deployed, and the search index is updated. Congratulations, and thank you!

=== Adding a module

=== Adding an appendix

What we are referring to as an "appendix", Antora calls a "component". If a particular topic is largely outside of the scope of The Data Mine curriculum for _most_ students, it may belong in an appendix instead. Adding an appendix to the book is straightforward. 

. Create a new repository (public) with the following, minimal structure.  Alternatively, you can copy the following files/directories from an existing appendix repository and copy into your new one: .github, .gitignore, content (directory), readme.md.
+
----
my_repo2
└── content
    ├── antora.yml
    └── modules
        └── ROOT
            ├── nav.adoc
            └── pages

4 directories, 2 files
----
+
. Fill in the content of the `antora.yml` configuration file. The following is an example of a minimal `antora.yml` file.
+
[source, yaml]
----
name: example-appendix
title: Example Appendix
version: master
display_version: stable
start_page: ROOT:introduction.adoc
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
Choose the `name` carefully. The `name` ends up appearing as the first value in the URL's path and should have no spaces. For example: \https://the-examples-book.com/example-appendix/<version>/<page-name>.
+
. Create and place the desired AsciiDoc content in the `pages` directory.  The introduction.adoc page will be the landing page for your appendix.  For new high level pages, add lines to the nav.adoc file. If you do create further navigation in nav.adoc, you can then create new .adoc files with the corresponding name in the `pages` directory. Make sure to follow our <<naming-convention, page naming convention>>.

. When you are satisfied with the results, modify the https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/blob/staging/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`] file in our https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book[primary repository], and create a Pull Request. This is as simple as adding another item to our menu:content[sources] section of the `.yml` file. For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
- url: https://github.com/my_organization/my_appendix_repo
  branches: main
  start_paths: content
----
+
In the https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book[primary repository] you will also need to change the https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/content/modules/ROOT/pages/introduction.adoc[`introduction.adoc`] file add a link on the homepage to your appendix.  For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
* xref:example-appendix:ROOT:introduction.adoc[Example Appendix]
----
+
When you are done making updates make sure to push all changes in both your new repository and the primary Examples Book repository.  All content incorporated into this book will be indexed and added to the search functionality by the maintainer.
+
[TIP]
Check out this book's https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/blob/staging/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`] file and https://github.com/TheDataMine/scholar-appendix[scholar appendix] for more details.

=== Designing for accessibility

Accessibility in website and content design is a vital aspect that is often overlooked. When adding new content to The Examples Book it is recommended that you follow as many of the accessibility guidelines below as possible. In addition, the Data Mine staff is continuing to learn about how we can make the examples book more accessible. If you have any suggestions, please email us at datamine@purdue.edu. 

It’s also important for us to note that we are not experts in accessibility. Our tips are based on the sources below, but the list is not exhaustive by any means. In our limited experience we recommend thinking through the different ways that people may access the site and attempting to design for as many of those ways as possible. 

==== Recommended Accessibility Links: 
- https://www.nationaldb.org/for-state-deaf-blind-projects/accessibility-toolkit/accessibile-content/[Accessibility Toolkit for State Deaf-Blind Projects]
- https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/[Web Accessibility Standards Guide]
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Cognitive_accessibility[Mozilla Guide for Web Accessibility]

==== High-level Checklist for Web and Content Design
- Is the site consistent in design (headings, lists, hierarchies)? 
- Is special text, such as code or quotes, easy to identify and understand?
- Does the text avoid abbreviations and clearly explain topic specific terms or phrases. 
- Do videos have captions, dictations, or other alternative communication methods?
- Do images have alternative text?
- If the images contain important information are there other methods for gaining the information?
- Are visualizations designed for easy understanding and clear readability?
- Are the visualizations designed for color blind individuals?

==== Tips for Checking Your Design
- Test with text-to-voice tools, such as VoiceOver for Mac. 
- Attempt to navigate the site without sound on the videos or other media. 
- Test visualizations with software tools that simulate colorblindness. 

== Organization

This book is organized into the **core book**, and **supplementary appendices**. 

The **core book** contains content we hope every student learns. For example, an code snippet showing how to read and write data to a file using Python, would most likely get added somewhere in the core book. 

**Supplementary appendices** are reserved for topics that are largely beyond the scope of The Data Mine curriculum for _most_ students. In certain cases, a corporate partner's team may be required to quickly learn about a topic. For example, perhaps a team is working on an app to translate natural language to an SQL query. In this scenario, a mentor may ask students to take a look at content in the NLP appendix. Before creating a Pull Request to add content, please take a moment to figure out _where_ that content most appropriately fits. When in doubt, please feel free to ask!

_Within_ the core book or an appendix, you will find a certain file structure.

The file structure is important. Special keywords in the provided example that should _not_ be modified are: 

<1> `content`
<2> `antora.yml`
<3> `modules`
<4> `ROOT`
<5> `attachments`
<6> `examples`
<7> `images`
<8> `pages`
<9> `partials`
<10> `nav.adoc`

[IMPORTANT]
While not specifically highlighted in the provided example, the `attachments`, `examples`, `images`, `pages`, and `partials` folders are examples of repeated keywords, or keywords that are reused in each module. While `nav.adoc` is not technically a special keyword, we would like to keep this consistent with all modules and appendices added to the book.

In addition, in the https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book[core book repository], you will find a file called https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/blob/staging/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`] in the root of the repository. This file is responsible for pulling in all of the resources for the core book and all of the dependencies. 

[NOTE]
This book uses https://antora.org/[Antora] to render the online book. The following is a summary of information that can be found online. For a more in-depth look at Antora, please see the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[official documentation].

content:: 
This is a directory at the root-level of the repository which should contain the `antora.yml` file and a `modules` directory.

antora.yml::
This is a configuration file that contains information about the book or appendix contained within the sibling `modules` directory. At the time of writing, this is what the core book's `antora.yml` file looked like.

modules::
The directory containing (at a minimum) the `ROOT` module, and any other custom-named modules you would like. In our example we also had a `module1` module and a `module2` module.

ROOT::
The `ROOT` module. This is the default, required module. No further modules are required. An appendix or core book may not need more than the `ROOT` module. In fact, our https://github.com/TheDataMine/scholar-appendix[scholar appendix] only contains the `ROOT` module.

attachments::
A "family directory" that should be used to store binaries or other large files. These attachments can then be referenced internally. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

examples::
A "family directory" that should be used to store examples. For this book, examples will most likely be code snippets. In practice, any potentially reuseable code snippet should be added to the `examples` directory. This enables maintainers to update a code snippet once, and have it applied _everywhere_ it appears in the book. These examples can be referenced internally, and included in a code chunk. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

images::
A "family directory" that should be used to store all figures and images. For this book, we will require all images to be labeled `figureXXX` where `XXX` is a number starting at `001` and ending at `999`. These images can be referenced internally. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

pages::
A "family directory" that should be used to store each page of the book. These are AsciiDoc files. This is where the actual content lives.

[NOTE]
====
[[naming-convention]]
include::partial$naming-convention.adoc[]
====

partials::
A "family directory" that should be used to store content snippets. Provided examples include common descriptions, terminology, or referenced tables. Any content that doesn't fit into a previously named "family directory", but will most likely be reused in multiple pages should be added as a _partial_ to the `partials` directory. Partials can be referenced internally. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

nav.adoc::
This folder contains a list of anchor links that end up as your navigation links in the menu on the left hand side of the book. For example, at the time of writing this, `modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` looked like this.

== AsciiDoc

This book is written using https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. AsciiDoc is an open and powerful format for writing notes, text documents, books, etc. It is easy to write technical documentation in AsciiDoc, and quickly convert the text to various mediums like websites, ebooks, pdfs, etc.

Below are a variety of AsciiDoc examples from https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[powerman]. To see how content is rendered, compare https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/staging/content/modules/ROOT/pages/how-to-contribute.adoc[the adoc file for this page], to it's output below.

=== Images

[IMPORTANT]
====
We want to keep this site fast. The following are best practices for adding images to this book.

- Reduce the size of images using the instructions <<optimize-images, here>>.
- Specify _both_ the height and width of each image.
- Lazy load images by adding `loading="lazy"`.
- Use block images when possible.
- Put all images in the associated modules "images" folder, and label them `figure01.webp`, `figure02.webp`, etc.
- Always add a caption by adding `title="Description of image."`
====

==== Inline images

To include an image inline from same module: image:figure01.png[Alternate text for figure01, height=25, width=25, loading=lazy]

To include an image inline from different module: image:geo:ROOT:crs.png[Alternate text for CRS, height=250, width=250, loading=lazy]

==== Block images

To include a block image from the same module:

image::figure01.png[Alternate text for figure01, height=25, width=25, loading=lazy]

To include a block image from a different module:

image::geo:ROOT:crs.png[Alternate text for CRS, height=250, width=250, loading=lazy]

=== UI Macros

==== Button syntax

Press btn:[Submit] when you are ready to submit and btn:[Cancel], if you want to cancel.

==== Keybinding syntax

To exit vim press kbd:[Ctrl+C], type `:wq`, and press kbd:[Enter].

==== Menu syntax

To exit, click on menu:File[Close].

To export as PDF, click on menu:File[Export as... > PDF].

=== Tables

=== LaTeX

We use https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] to render LaTeX. Our current configurations allow inline equations using \$'s and display equations using \$\$'s. To escape a regular \$, you can prepend a \, so, for example, to write \$2.00 you would type `\$2.00`.

This is an example of an inline equation: $e=mc^2$

We've configured MathJax to _not_ process text in the following tags: `<script>`, `<noscript>`, `<style>`, `<textarea>`, `<pre>`, `<annotation>`, `<annotation-xml>`, and `<code>`.

== Optimize images

We want to keep this book as fast to load as possible. The following are our suggestions to optimize images prior to adding them to this book.

.Resize the image to the width and height that it will be displayed online
[source, bash]
----
magick convert input.png -filter Gaussian -sharpen 0x3 -resize 700x500 output.png
----

.Reduce the number of colors used to 64
[source, bash]
----
pngquant 64 --skip-if-larger --strip --ext=.png --force output.png
----

.Use improved compression algorithm
[source, bash]
----
zopflipng -y output.png output.png
----

.Compress to webp
[source, bash]
----
cwebp -q 30 output.png -o output.webp
----

You can read more about some of these optimizations in https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/30/simple-trick-for-smaller-screenshots/[this excellent GitLab blog post].

=== Automator

If you are working on an Apple machine, you can setup Automator to automatically convert all `.png`'s as they are added to the repository.

. Open Automator.app, and select btn:[Folder Action], then click btn:[Choose].
+
image::figure02.webp[Automator menu, width=792, height=700, loading=lazy, title="Automator menu"]
+
. At the top of the screen choose folder where your the-examples-book repository lives. Drag and drop **Run Shell Script** from the left-hand menu.
+
image::figure03.webp[Automator setup, width=792, height=700, loading=lazy, title="Folder action setup"]
+
. Change **Pass input** to **as arguments**, and add the following script to the code block.
+
[source, bash]
----
include::example$example02.sh[]
----
+
. Open finder and navigate to each "images" folders which you'd like automator to watch, and automatically convert and optimize `.png` files. This can be easily done by holding kbd:[Ctrl+Click] on the directory and attaching the workflow to each folder.
