= Introducing The Data Mine - Transcript

Video opens with examples of Purdue's campus and students studying utilizing different technologies. 

*Narrator:* Data is everywhere. It touches nearly every aspect of our lives and is now considered one of the most valuable resources on earth. 20 billion devices are now connected to the internet, and by 2030 that number will reach 1 trillion.

*Jay Akridge, Provost:* All of these devices are constantly producing massive amounts of data. So how do we analyze data? How do we find meaning in it? How do we use it responsibly? These are some of the world's biggest challenges and here at Purdue University we're all about looking for answers to those challenges every day. 

*Narrator:* Data science is the study of large amounts of data and how to make actionable decisions from it. Whether it's in the classroom, arena, or lab, data is collected in everything we do. But to understand it, communicate it, and unlock its potential we require a new approach powered by a data fluent generation. 

Video shows example of different data from around Purdue. 8000 trees on campus, crowd capacity for the basketball stadium, and the number of students in a course and their grade level. 

*Jay Akridge:* It's very clear that as we look to the future the role of data has radically changed, which means we need to be thinking about what it means for the education our students receive. As we think about our university's focus on the persistent pursuit of innovation there's really just no better example than what's going on in The Data Mine. 

*Narrator:* The Data Mine is a fully immersive living and learning community for students, faculty, researchers, and corporate partners alike. One home, 800 students, 100 percent data infused innovation.

*Mark Daniel Ward, Director of The Data Mine:* It's really the idea of having data science for all. It's a way for students to learn about the data sciences while they're learning about their discipline. What we've done is we've kind of re-envisioned the residential learning environment. We often have visitors from companies, we often have alumni, we often have professional development seminars. You see students interacting, working in teams, the professors even have their office hours in the residence hall where the students live so it's pretty comprehensive. We call it an immersive experience. Our students live together, work together, and learn together. Everybody here's welcome. Everybody belongs here. Students don't have to have a major in science to be part of The Data Mine so we've made a data science education accessible for everyone. 

*Narrator:* Part of that accessibility is giving students in The Data Mine the opportunity to work on real world problems with corporate partners. We have more than 25 partnerships with global leaders like Beck's Hybrids, Ford Motor Company, Cummins and Microsoft. Students get hands-on project-based experience and that is how we are building a pipeline of data fluent graduates who are ready for the challenges of the workforce.

*Nick Rosenorn, Student:* We're looking to build a client-facing mobile application for clients in phase 3 clinical trials. We are looking to collect their biometric data, so their heart rate for example, their stairs climbed, their steps for the day, and so the idea is can we pair fitness trackers like Fitbit, Apple watch, Garmin with our mobile app and we're doing this project that's been going on for about a year and a half now. It's a complete data science and full stack project where we're dealing with loads of different software and different technologies and it's just a great opportunity for us to learn exactly what a full stack project is in industry.

*Brad Fruth, Beck's Hybrids:* Having data fluency is very important no matter if you work in finance, in IT, if you do supply chain, agronomy, everybody is dealing with a massive amount of data in their own vertical right now. 

*Mark Daniel Ward:* They're going to be able to use these skills when they go into industry. They're going to really have some expertise from day number one when they get hired with the company and the students are going to be really sought out as they're going through that recruiting and training process. 

*Narrator:* Purdue has been a global leader in education research and innovation for over 150 years and now we're continuing that success by pursuing the next giant leap in data science. 

*Jay Akridge:* This very unique learning environment where students from across our campus come together to solve real-world problems that are brought to them by external partners, industry, government, and not-for-profits. We couldn't be prouder of the work that's happening in The Data Mine and the future for where we can take that idea long term. 

*Brad Fruth:* If you want to increase your engagement with students, with faculty, with research, then you look at partnering with The Purdue Data Mine. They're giving you access to talent. They're also challenging your own staff to think in new and different ways and the value that is there is just incredible. 

*Mark Daniel Ward:* In every area of the workforce the need is imperative for our students to bring their expertise. Because of the unique experience they have in The Data Mine our students are ready to make a tremendous impact in the workforce as soon as they graduate from Purdue. 

*Narrator:* The Data Mine is Purdue's innovative step in solving today's toughest challenges. That's our giant leap.
