Data Visualization is a way to bring data to life. It's a form of story-telling. It also is a great way to get a bigger picture of your data, especially big data.

Let's look at the food reviews from Amazon.


[source, python]
----
# Install the pandas library
import pandas as pd
# Read the `amazon_fine_food_reviews` file in pandas
amazon_food = pd.read_csv("/depot/datamine/data/amazon/amazon_fine_food_reviews.csv")
# Print the first 5 lines to get some sense of the data
amazon_food.head()

We don't want to read every single review to get a better understanding what people feel about a particular product. It is time consuiming and uneffective. 

Instead, we can generate a word cloud that maps words with respect to frequency. In other words, bigger a word, more frequent it appears in the dataset.

How many distinct products are there in the dataset?

[source, python]
----
# Unique count of products in the dataset
len(amazon_food['ProductId'].value_counts())
----

----
74258
----

We have 74258 products in total, BUT if we run the code to find how many products only have one review, 

[source, python]
----
# Find the number of products that only have one review 
sum(amazon_food['ProductId'].value_counts()==1)
----

Note that in https://the-examples-book.com/book/python/variables#bool[bool], `True` has an equivalent value of 1, and `False` has an equivalent value of 0. 

we will see that 30408 of the products only have one review, and word clouds are highly unlikely to be helpful for those single reviewed products. 

Pick a product ID you're interested in and create a subset.

For this example, I'll use `ID = 'B007JFMH8M'`.

[source, python]
----
# Extract a smaller subset from the dataset specifically about ProductID B007JFMH8M and reset index
my_subset = amazon_food[amazon_food['ProductId']=='B007JFMH8M'].reset_index(drop=True)
----

Before we generate a word cloud, data wrangling is required. 

Words like "are", "thing", and "that" aren't very helpful and do not contribute to the data story. They are called `stopwords`. We want to remove all stopwords from the Amazon reviews.

We can easily receive a generalized list of stopwords from the library called wordcloud.

[source, python]
----
from wordcloud import STOPWORDS

print(STOPWORDS)
----

----
Output: 

{'having', 'few', 'further', 'him', 'have', 'i', 'were', 'who', 'why', 'below', "don't", 'or', 'ever', 'themselves', 'whom', 'theirs', "there's", "how's", 'our', ... }
----

Note that those stopwords consist punctuation, and we cannot depend nor assume that humans who wrote Amazon reviews would write in perfect English grammar. So it's a safer bet to remove all the puntuations in both stopwords and Amazon reviews to keep things consisten and also lowercase the reviews. 

To remove puntuations from the stopwords, we can run something like this line of code.

[source, python]
----
import string

words = [''.join(letter for letter in word if letter not in string.punctuation) for word in STOPWORDS if word]
----

----
Output:

['having', 'few', 'further', 'him', 'have', 'i', 'were', 'who', 'why', 'below', 'dont', 'or', 'ever', 'themselves', 'whom', 'theirs', 'theres', 'hows', 'our', 'ours', ...]
----

To remove any symbols and any funny-looking characters, we can use regular expression to keep alphanumeric characters only.

https://the-examples-book.com/book/projects/29000-f2021-project03#regular-expressions-irregularly-satisfying-introduction-to-grep-and-regular-expressions[The link] has a good starting section about regular expressions.

THIS REQUIRES A BREAKDOWN OF THE WHOLE LINE.

[source, python]
----
test['Text'] = my_subset['Text'].replace(r'[^A-Z a-z]', '', regex=True).apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word.lower() not in (words)]))
----

Because the function, `WordCloud`, only accepts https://the-examples-book.com/book/python/variables#str[`string`] format as argument, we can simply combine the whole `Text` column into a long string.

[source, python]
----
text = ' '.join(test['Text'])
----

Yay, data cleaning is completed at this point! Now, we can generate a wordcloud map.

To generate a wordcloud map in Jupyter, we simply can run this block of code.

[source, python]
----
word_cloud = WordCloud(width=3000, height=2000, collocations = False, background_color = 'white').generate(text)
plt.figure( figsize=(20,10),facecolor='k')
plt.imshow(word_cloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.tight_layout(pad=0)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
