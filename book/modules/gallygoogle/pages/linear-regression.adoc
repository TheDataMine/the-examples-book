# Linear Regression

**Goal**: The goal of this notebook is to give you a code playground to better understand the core components of a simple linear regression model. 

You are encouraged to play with the code and build your own examples. Working in this way helps to understand what the model is really doing. 

### First question: What is linear regression?
* Linear regression is a simple modeling technique that takes input (independent) variables and attempts to predict an output (dependent) variable. 
** Think taking minutes exercised per day (independent variable) and trying to predict time to run a mile (dependent variable).
* Linear regression focuses on a continuous dependent variable (can take on any numeric value and isn't ordered).
** If you don't understand categorical or continuous variables, it's worth it to take some time and https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/types-of-variable.php[dive in deeper]. 
** There are lots of great https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/choosing-regression-analysis/[resources] that can help you learn more about the different types of regression as well. 

### Second question: Why would we use linear regression?
* Linear regression is a method that allows us to predict new values! 
* If the model can learn enough about the patterns in the existing data, it can attempt to predict new values. 
** *Note:* the model assumes that the predictions follow a similar specific pattern, both now and in the future. If they don't, the model won't do very well.
** There are other modeling techniques that handle different data patterns. 
* Linear regression is also a core technique that many more advanced modeling types build off of. 

### Third question: How do we build said model?
* We'll go through what the model does in the following sections below, but at a high level, we attempt to fit a line to the data that we have.
* Once we have a line that fits, the data we can attempt to predict new values. 
* The graph below attempts to illustrate the different parts of the modeling process.
