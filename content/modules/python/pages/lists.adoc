== Overview

Lists are one of the most commonly used data types in Python. Some of the additional functionality covered in the following sections on this page help to illustrate why lists are so commonly used. While `(` are almost always associated with tuples square brackets `[` are the domain of lists: 

[source, python]
----
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5.5, "some_text"]
----

Lists are mutable meaning they can be muted... disregard that. Lists are mutable meaning that they can be changed after the list has initially been declared. This is notable different from the tuples which are immutable.

[source, python]
----
my_list = [1,2,3,"i_can_be_muted"]
my_list[3] = "still_not_the_right_word"
print(my_list)
----

----
[1,2,3,'still_not_the_right_word']
----

Just like tuples you can convert between the two types easily: 

[source, python]
----
lex_listor = [1,2,3] # I'm a list
super_tuple = tuple(lex_listor)
print(type(super_tuple))
----

----
<class 'tuple'>
----

== Indexing

R and Python are similar in a lot of ways. One key distinction to understand is how they index values. Python is 0-indexed where as R is 1-indexed. What does this mean? In practice in means that the placement of items in R always starts with 1. In comparison Python will always start with a 0. It's a little easier to understand in an example: 

[source, r]
----
my_r_list <- c("first", "second", "third", "fourth")
----

In this case since we are looking at R code the list indexing is: 

----
["first", "second", "third", "fourth"]
[   1,        2,        3,        4  ]
----

So if we wanted to access the "third" entry we could run: 

[source, r]
----
my_list[3]
----

However, in Python the same list is 0-indexed. An example is included below for comparison: 

[source, python]
----
my_list = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth"]
----

----
["first", "second", "third", "fourth"]
[   0         1        2         3   ]
----

If we wanted to get the "third" entry in the list we would use the code snippet below: 

[source, python]
----
my_list[2]
----

Thankfully some of the syntax is the same between Python and R. For example, the `:` continues to hold the same functionality between both languages (as long as you remember the index difference):

In R: 

[source, r]
----
my_list[1:2]
----

----
"first", "second"
----

In Python: 

[source, python]
----
my_list[0:1]
----

----
"first", "second"
----

Python also supports a second `:` that indicates a "jump": 

[source, python]
----
my_list[0:3:2]
----

----
"first", "third"
----

Sadly Python and R do differ in other ways. One major difference is how the two languages handle negative indexes. In R, they remove a value at the given position: 

[source, r]
----
my_list[c(-1,-2)]
----

----
"third", "fourth"
----

In Python, negative indexes just mean "start from the back of the list" instead of "start from the front". For example: 

[source, python]
----
my_list[-1]
----

----
"fourth"
----

Negative indexes can be a little confusing in Python because while positive indexes are 0-indexed negative indexes are not (not sure what -0 is). This means that `my_list[-4]` is valid. In this case it would return "first". However if you tried to print `my_list[4]` it would produce an IndexError because the last list value is `my_list[3]`. Don't worry if this is a bit confusing at first. It gets easier as you write more Python code.
