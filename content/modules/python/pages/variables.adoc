= Python Variables

== Overview
Python variables are very similar to how variables are used in R. The primary difference is that instead of using `<-` or `->` to assign variables, Python uses a single `=`. 

Python has a few key differences from R in regards to variable behavior. Information on variable assignment in Python can be found in the <<variable assignment, Variable Assigment>> section below. 

Similar to other programming languages Python has several core variable types. Overview of each variable type are included below:

* <<None, None>>
* <<NaN, NaN>>
* <<bool, bool>>
* <<str, str>>
* <<int, int>>
* <<float, float>>
* <<complex, complex>>


== Variable Assigment 

[source, python]
----
my_var = 4
----

This declares a variable with a value of 4. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Actually this is technically not true. Numbers between -5 and 256 (inclusive) are already pre-declared and exist within Python's memory before you assigned the value to my_var. The = operator simply forces my_var to point to that value that already exists! That is right, my_var is technically a pointer.
====

One of the most important differences between variables in R and Python is what is happening in the background. Take the code example below: 

[source, python]
----
my_var = 4
new_variable = my_var
my_var = my_var + 1
print(f"my_var: {my_var}\nnew_variable: {new_variable}")
----
----
my_var: 5
my_var: 4
----
[source, python]
----
my_var = [4,]
new_variable = my_var
my_var[0] = my_var[0] + 1
print(f"my_var: {my_var}\nnew_variable: {new_variable}")
----
----
my_var: [5]
new_variable: [5]
----

The first chunk of code behaves as you'd expect because `int` values are immutable, meaning the values cannot be changed. As a result, when we assign `my_var = my_var + 1`, `my_vars` value isn't changing. Instead `my_var` is just being pointed to a different value (in this case 5). In comparison `new_variable` still points to the value of 4. 

The second chunk of code is different because it is dealing with a mutable `list`. We first assign the first value (0 index) of the list to a value of 4. We then assign `my_var` to `new_variable`. Unlike the first example, this does **not** copy the values. Instead both `my_var` and `new_variable` point to the same mutable list object. When we then change the value of the list by 1 the change is reflected in each variable since they are pointing to the same object. 

An excellent article goes into more detail and can be found https://realpython.com/pointers-in-python/[here]. 

== None

`None` is a keyword used to define a null value. This would be the Python equivalent to R's `NULL`. If used in an if statement, `None` represents `False`. This does not mean `None` == `False`, in fact: 

[source, python]
----
print(None == False)
----

----
False
----

Even though `None` can represent `False` in an if statement Python does not evaluate the two as equivalent. 

== NaN

The difference between `NaN` and `None` in Python can be somewhat confusing. The `NaN` value stand for `not a number` and is commonly used to reference missing data. Python will often convert `None` values to `NaN` dynamically, especially when working with numbers. There are lots of methods to identify and remove or fill `NaN` values, but it is worth noting that Python will evaluate them with no issues for many operations. 

For example, if I wanted to sum the rows below and then remove any `NaN` values we could try the initial code snippet. 

[source, python]
----
col_1 = [np.nan, 50, 100]
ccol_2 = [np.nan, 100, 50]

example_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(col_1, col_2)), columns=['Value 1', 'Value 2'])
example_dataframe['example_sum'] = np.sum(example_dataframe, axis=1)
----

However, Python would evaluate this as the table below:
|====
|Value 1 |Value 2 |example_sum
|NaN |NaN |0
|50 |100 |150
|100 |50 |150
|====

If we were to try to remove `NaN` values based on the `example_sum` column no rows would be removed. In this case we'd want to remove or fill the `Nan` values prior to the aggregation (sum). 

== bool

A `bool` has two possible values: `True` and `False`. It is important to understand that technically they also correspond to integers:

[source, python]
----
print(True == 1)
----

----
True
----

[source, python]
----
print(False == 0)
----

----
True
----

The `True` and `False` values only correspond to 1 and 0 respectively. They will not evaulate in the same way for other numbers:

[source, python]
----
print(True == 2)
----

----
False
----

However, if used in an if statement numbers that do not equal 1 or 0 can evaulate to `True`. Think of the if statement below as asking the question `Does this value equal 3?` and returning `True` or `False` as a result. 

[source, python]
----
if 3:
    print("3 evaluates to True")
----

----
3 evaluates to True
----

== str

`str` indicate string in Python. String are "immutable sequences of Unicode code points". Strings can be surrounded in single quotes, double quotes, or triple quoted (with either single or double quotes):

[source, python]
----
print(f"Single quoted text is type: {type('test')}")
----

----
Single quoted text is type: <class 'str'>
----

[source, python]
----
print(f"Double quoted text is type: {type("test")}")
----

----
Double quoted text is type: <class 'str'>
----

[source, python]
----
print(f"Triple quoted with single quotes is type: {type('''test''')}")
----

----
Triple quoted with single quotes is type: <class 'str'>
----

[source, python]
----
print(f"Triple quoted with double quotes is type: {type("""test""")}")
----

----
Triple quoted with double quotes is type: <class 'str'>
----

The benefit of triple quoting a string is that it can span multiple lines in the code. These lines will include the whitespace between the text: 

[source, python]
----
my_string = """This text
spans multiple
lines."""
print(my_string)
----

----
This text
spans multiple
lines.
----

However, if we tried the same thing without triple quotes: 

[source, python]
----
my_string = "This text,
will throw an error"
print(my_string)
----

In Python you do have the ability for other code to span multiple lines using `\`, but newlines won't be maintained: 

[source, python]
----
my_string = "This text, \
will throw an error"
print(my_string)
----

----
This text, will throw an error
----

== int

`int` values are whole numbers. For instance: 

[source, python]
----
my_var = 5
print(type(my_var))
----

----
<class 'int'>
----

`int` values can be added, subtracted, or multiplied without changing the variable type. However, divison of `int` values will change the variable type to <<float, float>> whether or not the result of the division is a whole number: 

[source, python]
----
print(type(6+2-2*2))
----

----
<class 'int'>
----

[source, python]
----
print(type(6/2))
----

----
<class 'float'>
----

Similarly, any calculation between an `int` and a `float` results in a `float`: 

[source, python]
----
print(type(6+2.0)) ## 2.0 is a float
----

----
<class 'float'>
----

== float

`float` values are floating point numbers. Also known as numbers with decimals.

[source, python]
----
my_var = 5.0
print(type(my_var))
----

----
<class 'float'>
----

`float` values can be converted back to `int` using the `int` function. This _coercion_ causes the `float` value to be truncated, regardless of how close to the "next" number the float is. *Note:* This will not round a number in the way that you would expect. There are `round` functions in Python that have the more expected functionality. 

[source, python]
----
print(int(5.5))
----

----
5
----

[source, python]
----
print(int(5.9999))
----

----
5
----

== complex

`complex` values represent complex numbers. For example, `j` can be used to represent an imaginary number. In order for Python to understand this `j` must be preceded by a number. For example `1j`. 

[source, python]
----
my_var = 1j
print(my_var)
----

----
1j
----

[source, python]
----
print(type(my_var))
----

----
<class 'complex'>
----

Arithmetic with a `complex` value always results in a `complex`: 

[source, python]
----
print(type(1j * 2))
----

----
<class 'complex'>
----

Unlike the other types mentioned above, you cannot convert a `complex` value to an `int` or `float`: 

[source, python]
----
print(int(1j*1j))
print(float(1j*1j))
----

----
Python error :(
