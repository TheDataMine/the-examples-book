= Control Flow

== Introduction
While it sounds technical, "control flow" encapsulates the idea of repeating, skipping, or directing your code given certain conditions -- more succinctly, loops and conditionals! This section will introduce you to:

* if/else statements
* for and while loops
* keywords including break, continue, and enumerate
* list comprehension syntax

Our goal is to help you master these fundamental tenets of programming, whose applications and concepts reach far beyond Python.

== If/Else Statements & Boolean Logic

The idea of if/else statements is grounded in basic logic and can be applied laterally across many programming languages. Python's syntax, however, makes this even easier: 

[source,python]
----
racks = False

if racks:
  print("ARE YOU WITH THAT?")
else:
  print("Nope")
----

----
Nope
----

The key differences here compared to most languages are the lack of semicolons, curly braces, and parentheses, characters which occasionally plague program compiling and running in other languages.

[NOTE]
====
Parentheses are still acceptable! If you're more comfortable putting parentheses around your statements, feel free.
====

The tradeoff in Python is that indentation is crucial. If statements aren't properly indented after the if/else colons, then the program won't run as desired. Take the following examples: 

[source,python]
----
value = 35
if value < 42: 
  print("This value suffices.")
  if value < 32: 
    print("This value suffices the lower limit.")
    print("This value suffices both limits.")
----

----
This value suffices.
----

[source,python]
----
value = 35
if value < 42: 
  print("This value suffices.")
  if value < 32: 
    print("This value suffices the lower limit.")
  print("This value suffices both limits.")
----

----
This value suffices.
This value suffices both limits.
----

The difference between the two examples is a mere two spaces, but because indentation is so important, the second example does not function as desired.

[TIP]
====
Many Python IDEs will allow you to alter the standard amount of space taken up by tabs. We use 2-space tabs for the examples to preserve space, but it's common to see 4-space tabs, as other programming languages use `\t` and four spaces interchangeably. _Use whatever you please, you just have to stay consistent!_

One final note is on the *walrus operator*. Yes, you read that right. Wanna guess what it looks like?

`:=`

I call him Dave. Unfortunately, the walrus operator is not an ultra-powerful culmination of everything control flow has to offer, but it is the only code representative of both _assignment_ and _expression_ simultaneously: 

[source,python]
----
if value := 44 > 44:
  print("Value is greater than 44.")
else:
  print("Value is not greater than 44.")
----

----
Value is not greater than 44.
----

While the above example is not exactly intuitive or useful, the walrus operator is crucial for eliminating repetition in longer (and often harder-to-debug) statements.

== Loops: For and While

The tandem-duo of loops and lists is one of the most prominent structural combinations you'll see in programming: 

=== For Loops

[source,python]
----
# this is a pangram, which is not a programming structure,
# but an English one. Programming nerds are not a monolith!
# Some of us like books too
my_list = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
----

----
the
quick
brown
fox
jumped
over
the
lazy
dog
----

The underlying structure of a for loop is important: 

* `for` and `in` are keywords; they assert "*for* every element *in* this list, do some action," which is exactly what Python does. 
* `item` is a variable that you call within the loop, and it will change depending on the situation: looping through a list of Strings? `item` can use String functions. Looping through a list of integers? Smack some mathematical operations on `item`. Call the variable whatever you like, as long as your reference to it is consistent, the name does not matter.
* `my_list` (or whatever you have at the end of the statement) is an *iterable*, or something you can iterate/loop through. The existence of iterables as a blanket term for lists, dictionaries, etc. reinforces the compatibility of loops with data structures. Iterables will return `True` when tested using `iter(element)` if you're unsure of a variable's compatibility with loops.

[NOTE]
====
Python does _not_ have a "for-each" loop like some object-oriented languages; however, the standard for loop operates much more like a for-each loop than an object-oriented for loop. 
====

You will probably run across iterables containing iterables -- lists of tuples, tuples of tuples, lists of lists, etc. Python's for loops can cover these cases as well, as seen in this example using xref:printing-and-f-strings.adoc[formatting strings.]

[source,python]
----
tuple_of_tuples = (("first", 1), ("second", 2), ("third", 3))

for my_string, my_value in tuple_of_tuples:
    print(f'my_string: {my_string}, my_value: {my_value}')
----

----
my_string: first, my_value: 1
my_string: second, my_value: 2
my_string: third, my_value: 3
----
