Some of the primary packages include: `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `bokeh`, `seaborn`, `plotnine`, `pygal`, `mpld3`, and many others. In Python `matplotlib` tends to be the initial focus when learning to plot. However, may of the libraries have other specializations and use cases that can come in handy when creating visualizations.
