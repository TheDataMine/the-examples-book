Since this vector has an even number of values (6 in this case), there will be two medians. In this case, the medians are the 3rd and 4th value in ascending order. In situations with multiple medians, the mean of the two medians is taken.

median(c(3,2,4,6,5,1))

[1] 3.5

For this example, the median would be the mean of the 3rd and 4th value in ascending order, which would be (3+4)/2, giving us 3.5 as our median.
