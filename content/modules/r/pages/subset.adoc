= `subset`

`subset`  is a function that helps you take subsets of data. By default, `subset` removes NA rows.

NOTE: `subset` does not perform any operation that can't be accomplished by indexing.

With indexing, we would write something like:

[source, R]
----
grades[grades$year=="junior" | grades$sex=="M",]$grade
----

[source, R]
----
[1] 100  75  74  69  88  99  90  92
----

Using `subset`, we can instead do this:


[source, R]
----
subset(grades, year=="junior" | sex=="M", select=grade)
----

[source, R]
----
   grade
1    100
3     75
4     74
6     69
7     88
8     99
9     90
10    92
----

But be careful, if we replace a grade with an NA, it will be removed by subset:

[source, R]
----
grades$sex[8] <- NA
subset(grades, year=="junior" | sex=="M", select=grade)
----

[source, R]
----
   grade
1    100
3     75
4     74
6     69
7     88
9     90
10    92
----

Whereas indexing will not unless you specify to:

[source, R]
----
grades[grades$year=="junior" | grades$sex=="M",]$grade
----

[source, R]
----
[1] 100  75  74  69  88  NA  90  92
----

In the 84.51 data set:
[source, R]
----
myDF <- read.csv("/class/datamine/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv")
----
We recall that these are the variables:
[source, R]
----
head(myDF)
----

INCLUDE OUTPUT HERE

[source, R]
----
dim(myDF)
----

INCLUDE OUTPUT HERE

There are 10625553 rows and 9 columns.

We can use the `subset` function to focus on only the purchases from the `CENTRAL` store region, in the `YEAR 2016`. We can also pick which variables (columns) that we want to include in the new data frame.

NOTE: We do not need to specify `myDF` on each variable, because the `subset` function will keep track of this for us. 
The `subset` function knows which data set that we are working with, because we specify it as the first parameter in the `subset` function. 
The structure of the `subset` function is as follows: `subset(x, subset, select, drop=FALSE, ...)`. 
The `subset` parameter of the `subset` function describes the rows that we are interested in. (In particular, we specify the conditions that we want the rows to satisfy.)
The `select` parameter of the `subset` function describes the columns that we are interested in. (We list the columns by their names, and we need to put each such column name in double quotes.)

[source, R]
----
myfocusedDF <- subset(myDF, subset=(STORE_R=="CENTRAL") & (YEAR==2016), 

select=c("PURCHASE_","PRODUCT_NUM","SPEND","UNITS") )
----

INCLUDE OUTPUT HERE

This new data set has only 1246144 rows, i.e., about 12 percent of the purchases, as expected. It also has only the 4 columns that we specified in the `subset` function.

Here is an example of how to use the `subset` function with the data from the federal election campaign contributions from 2016:

[source, R]
----
library(data.table)
myDF <- fread("/class/datamine/data/election/itcont2016.txt", sep="|")
----

[source, R]
----
dim(myDF)
----

INCLUDE OUTPUT HERE

We can use the `subset` command to focus on the donations made from Midwest states, and limit our results to those donations that had positive `TRANSACTION_AMT` values. We can extract interesting variables, e.g., the `NAME`, `CITY`, `STATE`, and `TRANSACTION_AMT`.

[source, R]
----
mymidwestDF <- subset(myDF, subset=(STATE %in% c("IN","IL","OH","MI","WI")) & (TRANSACTION_AMT > 0),

select=c("NAME","CITY","STATE","TRANSACTION_AMT") )
----

[source, R]
----
dim(mymidwestDF)
----

INCLUDE OUTPUT HERE

The resulting data frame has 2435825 rows.

[source, R]
----
tail(sort(tapply(mymidwestDF$TRANSACTION_AMT, mymidwestDF$NAME, sum)))
----

INCLUDE OUTPUT HERE

From the data set, we can `sum` the `TRANSACTION_AMT` values, grouped according to the `NAME` of the donor, and we find that `EYCHANER, FRED` was the top donor living in the midwest, during the 2016 federal election campaigns.
