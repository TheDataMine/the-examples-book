= `which`

Similar to `type`, `which` is a command that is used to learn more about other Unix commands. In fact, `which` displayes the location of the argument's executable. In easier-to-understand terminology, `which` shows where the tool in question is located in your computer's file system.

Here is an example of using `which`. In this case, we are finding the file location of the `pwd` executable:

----
which pwd
----

When I run this on my local machine, I recieve the following output:

----
/bin/bash
----

This means that my `pwd` executable is stored in the `/bin/pwd` file.

`which` can be helpful in a number of ways, but is in unlikely that you will need to use in much during Seminar. However, there are sometimes where more than one version of an *executable* program on your machine. In this case, it would be useful to know which of these programs you are using.
