= `pwd`

When navigating between directories, it is important to know where you are! That is what the `pwd` command allows you to do. When the `pwd` command is run, the current working directory (the folder that you are in) is printed to the terminal. The path that is printed is the _absolute path_ of the working directory. Let's try it out. Simply run:

[source, bash]
----
pwd
----

This will return the path of your current working directory, and could look something like this:

.Output
----
/home/john/
----

Like the `ls` command, you will find yourself using this command a lot! `pwd` provides a quick and easy way to check your working directory, and it especially useful when finding the path of a file you may want to import, or a folder that you want to write to.

At all times, the environment variable `$PWD` stores the current working directory. You can verify this by running the following command.

[source,bash]
----
echo $PWD
----

.Output
----
/home/john/
----
