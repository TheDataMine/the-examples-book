= `pwd`

When navigating betwen directories, it is important to know where you are! That is what `pwd` allows you to do. When the `pwd` command is run, the current working directory (the folder that you are in) is printed to the terminal. The path that is printed is the full system path of the working directory. Let's try it out. Simply run:

----
pwd
----

This will return the path of your current working directory, and could look something like this:

----
/Usr/jdoe/Documents/school
----

Like the `ls` command, you will find yourself using this command a lot! `pwd` provides a quick and easy way to check your working directory, and it especially useful when finding the path of a file you may want to import, or a folder that you want to write to.
