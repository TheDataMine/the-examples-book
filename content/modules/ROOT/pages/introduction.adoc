This book contains a collection of examples that students can use to reinforce topics learned in https://datamine.purdue.edu[The Data Mine] seminar at https://purdue.edu[Purdue University]. It is an excellent resource for students to learn what they need to know in order to solve The Data Mine projects.

This book is broken down into "core" topics that are covered in seminar. These topics are listed in the left-hand side menu. They include topics like Python, R, SQL, and other critical languages and tools used to solve data-driven problems. In addition, the live version of the "core" book contains the most up-to-date slate of projects students in The Data Mine are working on. All projects from previous semesters live in the xref:projects:ROOT:introduction.adoc[Projects Archive] appendix.

Complementary to the "core" book are the appendices. These are relevant special topics that are not necessarily covered in seminar, but may be useful to certain students or groups. The following are a list of appendices:
