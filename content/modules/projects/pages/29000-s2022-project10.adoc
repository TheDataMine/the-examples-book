= STAT 29000: Project 10 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** The use of a suite of packages referred to as the `tidyverse` is popular with many R users. It is apparent just by looking at `tidyverse` R code, that it varies greatly in style from typical R code. It is useful to gain some familiarity with this collection of packages, in case you run into a situation where these packages are needed -- you may even find that you enjoy using them!

**Context:** We've covered a lot of ground so far this semester, and almost completely using Python. In this next series of projects we are going to switch back to R with a strong focus on the `tidyverse` (including `ggplot`) and data wrangling tasks.

**Scope:** R, tidyverse, ggplot

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use mutate, pivot, unite, filter, and arrange to wrangle data and solve data-driven problems.
- Combine different data using joins (left_join, right_join, semi_join, anti_join), and bind_rows.
- Group data and calculate aggregated statistics using group_by, mutate, summarize, and transform functions.
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings, in `ggplot`.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

The "tidyverse" consists of a variety of packages, including, but not limited to: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `magrittr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `lubridate`.

One of the underlying premises of the tidyverse is getting the data to be tidy. You can read a lot more about this in Hadley Wickham's book, https://r4ds.had.co.nz/[R for Data Science].

There is an excellent graphic https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html[here] that illustrates a general workflow for data science projects:

. Import
. Tidy
. Iterate on, to gain understanding:
.. Transform
.. Visualize
.. Model
. Communicate

This is a good general outline of how a project could be organized, but depending on the project or company, this could vary greatly and change as the goals of a project change.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/beer/beers.csv`
- `/depot/datamine/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

++++

The first step in our workflow is to read the data.

Read the datasets `beers.csv` and `reviews_sample.csv` using the `read_csv` function from `tidyverse` into tibbles called `beers` and `reviews`, respectively.

[NOTE]
====
"Tibble" are essentially the `tidyverse` equivalent to data.frames. They function slightly differently, but are so similar (today) that we won't go into detail until we need to.
====

In projects 10 and 11, we want to analyze and compare different beers. Note, that in `reviews` each row corresponds to a review by a certain user on a certain date. As reviews likely vary by individuals, we may want to summarize our `reviews` tibble.

To do that, let's start by deciding how we are going to summarize the reviews. Start by picking one of the variables (columns) from the `reviews` dataset to be our "beer goodness indicator". For example, maybe you believe that the `taste` is important in beverages (seems reasonable). 

Now, determine a summary statistic that we will use to compare beers based on your beer goodnees indicator variable. Examples include `mean`, `median`, `std`, `max`, `min`, etc. Write 1-2 sentences describing why you chose the statistic you chose for your variable(s). You can use annectodal evidence (some reasoning why you think that summary statistics would be appropriate/useful here), or look at the distribution based on plots, or summary statistics to pick your preferred summary statistics for this case. 

[NOTE]
====
If you are making a plot, please be sure to use the `ggplot` package.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you wanted to have some fun, you could decide to combine different variables into a single one. For instance, maybe you want to take into consideration both `taste` and `smell`, but you want a smaller weight for `smell`. Then, you create a plot of `taste + .5*smell`, and you notice the data is skewed, so you decide to go with the `median`, namely, with `median(taste+.5*smell)`.

=== Question 2

<iframe class="video" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.79.1/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/983291/uiconf_id/29134031/entry_id/1_nao1734y?wid=_983291"></iframe>
++++

Now that we have decided how to compare beers, let's create a new variable called `beer_goodness_indicator` in the reviews dataset. For each `beer_id`, https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html?q=summarize#ref-usage[`summarize`] the `reviews` data to get a single `beer_goodness_indicator` based on your answer from question 1. Call this summarized dataset `reviews_summary`.

[TIP]
====
`reviews_summary` should be 41822x2 (rows x columns).
====

[TIP]
====
`summarize` is good when you want to keep your data grouped -- it will result in a data.frame with a different number of rows and columns. `mutate` is very similar except it will maintain the original columns, add a new column where the grouped/summarized values are repeated based on the variable the data was grouped by. This may be confusing, but run the following two examples and this will be made clear.

[source,r]
----
mtcars %>%
    group_by(cyl) %>%
    summarize(mpg_mean = mean(mpg))
----

[source,r]
----
mtcars %>%
    group_by(cyl) %>%
    mutate(mpg_mean = mean(mpg))
----
====

[TIP]
====
You may be wondering what the heck the `%>%` part of the code from the previous tip is. These are pipes from the `magrittr` package. This is used to together functions. For example, `group_by` and `summarize` are two functions that can be chained together. You are passing the output from the previous function as the input to the next function. You'll find this is a very clean and convenient way to express a lot of very common data wrangling tasks! 

It could be as simple as getting the `head` of a dataframe.

[source,r]
----
head(mtcars)
----

You could instead use pipes:

[source,r]
----
mtcars %>% 
    head()
----

Why? This second version is arguably easier to read, and it is easier to edit. You could easily want to add a column to the dataframe first.

[source,r]
----
mtcars %>%
    mutate(my_new_column = mean(cyl)) %>%
    head()
----

Now, if we had the non-piped version it would be something like:

[source,r]
----
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
    mutate(my_new_column = mean(cyl))

head(mtcars)
----

Or an even better example would be:

[source,r]
----
mtcars %>%
    round() %>%
    head()
----

Versus:

[source,r]
----
head(round(mtcars))
----
====

[TIP]
====
`mutate` in particular is extremely useful. Try to perform the same operation using `pandas` and you will quickly realize how _nice_ some of the `tidyverse` functionality is.

Let's combine our `beers` dataset with `reviews_summary` into a new dataset called `beers_reviews` that contains only beers that appears in *both* datasets. Use the appropriate https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html?q=left_join#types-of-join[`join`] function from `tidyverse` (`inner_join`, `left_join`, `right_join`, or `full_join`) to solve this problem. Since you saw some examples using pipes in the previous question (`%>%`) -- use pipes from here on out.

What are the dimensions of the resulting `beers_reviews` dataset? How many beers did _not_ appear in both datasets?

Ok, now we have the dataset ready to analyze! For beers that are available during the entire year (see `availability`), is there a difference between `retired` and not retired beers in terms of `beer_goodness_indicator`? 

1. Start by subsetting the dataset using https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html[`filter`]. 
2. Create some data-driven method to answer this question. You can make a plot, get summary statistics (average `beer_goodness_indicator`, table comparing # of beers with `beer_goodness_indicator` > 4 for each category, etc). You can use multiple methods to answer this question! Have fun!

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- 1-2 sentences answering the comparing `retired` and not retired beers in terms of `beer_goodness_indicator` based on your chosen method(s). Did the results surprise you?
- 1-2 sentences explaining what data-driven method(s) you decided to use and why.

Let's compare different styles of beer based on our `beer_goodness_indicator` average. Create a Cleveland dotplot (using `ggplot`) comparing the average `beer_goodness_indicator` for each style in `beers_reviews`. Make sure to use the `tidyverse` functions to answer this question and to use `ggplot`.

[TIP]
====
The code below creates a Cleveland dotplot comparing `Sepal.Length` variation per `Species` using the `iris` dataset. 

[source,r]
----
iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(petal_length_var = sd(Petal.Length)) %>%
  arrange(desc(petal_length_var)) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Species, y = petal_length_var)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Petal length variation")
----
====

[TIP]
====
You can use the function https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/top_n.html?q=top_n#null[`top_n(x)`] in combination with https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/grouping.html?q=arrange#arrange[`arrange`] to subset to show only the top x styles.
