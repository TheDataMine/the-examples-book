= STAT 39000: Project 5 -- Fall 2021

== Testing Python: part II

**Motivation:** Code, especially newly written code, is refactored, updated, and improved frequently. It is for these reasons that testing code is imperative. Testing code is a good way to ensure that code is working as intended. When a change is made to code, you can run a suite a tests, and feel confident (or at least more confident) that the changes you made are not introducing new bugs. While methods of programming like TDD (test-driven development) are popular in some circles, and unpopular in others, what is agreed upon is that writing good tests is a useful skill and a good habit to have.

**Context:** This is the first of a series of two projects that explore writing unit tests, and doc tests. In The Data Mine, we will focus on using `pytest`, `doctest`, and `mypy`, while writing code to manipulate and work with data.

**Scope:** Python, testing, pytest, mypy, `doctest`

.Learning Objectives
****
- Write and run unit tests using `pytest`.
- Include and run doc tests in your docstrings, using `doctest`.
- Gain familiarity with `mypy`, and explain why static type checking can be useful.
- Comprehend what a function is, and the components of a function in Python.
