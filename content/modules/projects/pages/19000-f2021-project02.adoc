= STAT 19000: Project 2 -- Fall 2021

== Introduction to R using https://whin.org[WHIN] weather data

**Motivation:** The R environment is a powerful tool to perform data analysis. R is a tool that is often compared to Python. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and both are worth learning. In this project we will dive in head first and learn some of the basics while solving data-driven problems.

[NOTE]
====
R and Python both have their advantages and disadvantages. There still exist domains and problems where R is better than Python, and where Python is better than R. In addition, https://julialang.org/[Julia] is another language in this domain that is quickly gaining popularity for it's speed and Python-like ease of use.
====

**Context:** In the last project we set the stage for the rest of the semester. We got some familiarity with our project templates, and modified and ran some R code. In this project, we will continue to use R within Jupyter Lab to solve problems. Soon, you will see how powerful R is and why it is often a more effective tool to use than a tool like spreadsheets.

**Scope:** r, vectors, indexing, recycling

.Learning Objectives
****
- List the differences between lists, vectors, factors, and data.frames, and when to use each.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Read and write basic (csv) data using R. 
- Identify good and bad aspects of simple plots. 
- Explain what "recycling" is in R and predict behavior of provided statements.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/whin/stations.csv`
- `/depot/datamine/data/whin/weather.csv`

[NOTE]
====
These datasets are generously provided to us by one of our corporate partners, the Wabash Heartland Innovation Network (WHIN). You can learn more about WHIN on their website at https://whin.org/[WHIN]. You can learn more about their API https://data.whin.org[here]. This won't be the last time we work with WHIN data, in the future you will get the opportunity to use their API to solve problems that you might not have thought of.

== Questions

=== Question 1

While you may not always (and perhaps even rarely) be provided with a neat and clean dataset to work on, when you do, getting a good feel for the dataset(s) is a good first step to solving any data-driven problems. 

Use the `read.csv` function to load our datasets into `data.frame`s named `stations` and `weather`.

[NOTE]
====
`read.csv` loads data into a `data.frame` object _by default_. We will learn more about the idea of a `data.frame` in the future. For now, just think of it like a spreadsheet, in which data in each column has the same type of data (e.g. numeric data, strings, etc.).
====

Use functions like `head`, `tail`, `str`, and `summary` to explore the data. What are the dimensions of each dataset? What are the first 5 rows of `stations`? What are the first 5 rows of `weather`? What are the names of the columns in each dataset?

The following R code extracts the `temperature` column from our `weather` `data.frame`, into a vector named `temp`.

[source,r]
----
temp <- weather$temperature
----

What is the first value in the vector? How about the 100th? What is the last? What type of data is in the vector?

[TIP]
====
Use the `typeof` function to find out the type of data in a vector.

You should now know at least 1 method for extracting data from a `data.frame` (using the `$`), and should now understand a little bit about indexing. Thats great! Use indexing to add the first 100 `rain_inches_last_hour` from the `weather` `data.frame` to the last 100 `rain_inches_last_hour` from the `weather` `data.frame` to a new vector named `temp100`. Do this in 1 line of code.

In question (3) we were able to rapidly add values together from two subsets of the same vector. This worked out very nicely because both subsets of data contained 100 values. The first value from the first subset of data was added to the first value from the second subset of data, and so on. 

For station with `station_id` 20, get a vector containing all `temperature` >= 85. Call this vector `hot_temps`. Get a vector containing all `temperature` \<= 40, and call this vector `cold_temps`. How many elements are in `hot_temps`? How many elements are in `cold_temps`? Attempt to add the vectors together. What happens? Read https://excelkingdom.blogspot.com/2018/01/what-recycling-of-vector-elements-in-r.html[this] to understand what is happening.

[NOTE]
====
This is called _recycling_. Recycling is a very powerful feature of R. It allows you to reuse the same vector elements in different contexts. It can also be a very misleading and dangerous feature as it can lead to unexpected results. This is why it is important to pay attention when R gives you a warning -- something that you aren't expecting may be happening behind the scenes.

Pick any station you are interested in, and create one or more dotplots showing data from any of the columns you are interested in. For each plot, write 1-2 sentences describing any patterns you see. If you don't see any patterns, that is okay, just write, "I don't see any patterns.".

[TIP]
====
This is a good opportunity to look at the data in the dataset and explore the variables and see what types of patterns the various variables have. Please feel free to spruce up your plots if you so desire -- it is completely optional, and we will have plenty of time to work on plots as the semester progresses.

=== Question 6

The following three pieces of code each create a graphic. The first two graphics are created using only core R functions. The third graphic is created using a package called `ggplot`. We will learn more about all of these things later on. For now, pick your favorite graphic, and write 1-2 sentences explaining why it is your favorite, what could be improved, and include any interesting observations (if any).
