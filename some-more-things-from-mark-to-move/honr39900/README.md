## Course Description
Maps are everywhere around us: in our cars, on our phones, and driving public health initiatives. Geospatial skills and knowledge are increasingly sought after in industry, and will continue to prove vital to Data Science. You will learn how to create maps and analyze spatial data using Python and SQL, how spatial data are applied in a variety of domains, and have hands-on experiences with real data. Together, we will answer questions such as: (1) what are maps, (2) how can we create maps from data, (3) and how do we quantify and analyze maps. Applied geospatial projects will include: autonomous vehicles, public health, supply chain, and more.

 - Homework (10 assignments at 50 points each, for a total of 500 points; ongoing, but due at 23:59 EST/EDT the day before our class). These will be interactive assignments, such as Jupyter notebooks, or .py files which must pass a series of unit tests. Grades will be provided based on passing unit tests, accuracy, and completing the assignment, per the provided instructions.
 - Midterm project (200 points; due October 11 at 23:59 EDT). Details about this project are in Brightspace under Assignments, including the grading rubric. A presentation will be given in class on October 18.
 - Final project (300 points; due December 13 at 23:59 EST). Details about this project are in Brightspace under Assignments, including the grading rubric. A final presentation will be given in class during finals week.

## Makeup Work and Due Dates
I want to see you learn, grow, succeed, and come to love geospatial analytics as much as I do. It is your responsibility to turn in all work and projects before the due date. With that being said, life happens, and flexibility is sometimes required—especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is OK! If you are having any issues with the assignments or projects, which may mor may not impact your ability to submit by the due date, please email me ASAP. We will work together to come up with an amicable solution. Please see below for makeup work policies:
 - **Homework:** If you miss a due date, and I do not hear from you before the prescribed due date/have a documented emergency, you will receive a 0 for that assignment, and there will be no makeup work available.
 - **Projects:** If you miss a due date, and I do not hear from you before the prescribed due date/have a documented emergency, your project portion of the grade (not the presentation portion) will reduce 100 points every day the project is not submitted.

## Grading Scale
In this class, grades reflect the sum of your achievement throughout the semester. You will accumulate points as described in the assignments portion above. At the end of the semester, final grades will be calculated by adding the total points earned and translating those numbers (out of 1000) into the following letters (there will be no partial points or rounding).

|Grade|Points Earned|
|-----|-------------|
|A+   |965-1000     |
|A    |940-964      |
|A-   |900-939      |
|B+   |865-899      |

## Attendance Policy during COVID-19
Students are expected to attend all classes in-person unless they are ill or otherwise unable to attend class. If they feel ill, have any symptoms associated with COVID-19, or suspect they have been exposed to the virus, students should stay home and contact the Protect Purdue Health Center at (765) 496-INFO. If this applies to you, do not—under any circumstances—come to class.

In the current context of COVID-19, in-person attendance cannot be a factor in the final grades. However, timely completion of alternative assessments can certainly be part of the final grade. Students need to inform the instructor of any conflict that can be anticipated and will affect the timely submission of an assignment or the ability to take an exam. 

Classroom engagement is extremely important and associated with your overall success in the course. The importance and value of course engagement and ways in which you can engage with the course content even if you are in quarantine or isolation, will be discussed at the beginning of the semester.

Only the instructor can excuse a student from a course requirement or responsibility. When conflicts can be anticipated, such as for many University-sponsored activities and religious observations, the student should inform the instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible. For unanticipated or emergency conflicts, when advance notification to an instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor/instructional team as soon as possible by email. In cases of bereavement, quarantine, or isolation, the student or the student’s representative should contact the Office of the Dean of Students via [email](mailto:odos@purdue.edu) or phone at (765) 494-1747.

## Academic Guidance in the Event a Student is Quarantined/Isolated
If you must quarantine or isolate at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can continue to learn remotely. Work with the Protect Purdue Health Center (PPHC) to get documentation and support, including access to an Academic Case Manager who can provide you with general guidelines/resources around communicating with your instructors, be available for academic support, and offer suggestions for how to be successful when learning remotely. Your Academic Case Manager can be reached at acmq@purdue.edu. Importantly, if you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your academic case manager and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation.

## Classroom Guidance Regarding Protect Purdue
The [Protect Purdue Plan](https://protect.purdue.edu/plan/), which includes the [Protect Purdue Pledge](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/?_ga=2.210401429.1213937682.1590527202-1814553957.1589408073), is campus policy and as such all members of the Purdue community must comply with the required health and safety guidelines. Required behaviors in this class include: staying home and contacting the Protect Purdue Health Center (765) 496-INFO if you feel ill or know you have been exposed to the virus, properly wearing a mask [in classrooms and campus buildings](https://protect.purdue.edu/updates/face-covering-protocols/), at all times (e.g., mask covers nose and mouth, no eating/drinking in the classroom), disinfecting desk/workspace before and after use, maintaining appropriate social distancing with peers and instructors (including when entering/exiting classrooms), refraining from moving furniture, avoiding shared use of personal items, maintaining robust hygiene (e.g., handwashing, disposal of tissues) prior to, during and after class, and following all safety directions from the instructor.

Students who are not engaging in these behaviors (e.g., wearing a mask) will be offered the opportunity to comply. If non-compliance continues, possible results include instructors asking the student to leave class and instructors dismissing the whole class. Students who do not comply with the required health behaviors are violating the University Code of Conduct and will be reported to the Dean of Students Office with sanctions ranging from educational requirements to dismissal from the university.

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person in a campus room (e.g., classroom) is threatening the safety of others by not complying (e.g., not properly wearing a mask) may leave the room without consequence. The student is encouraged to report the behavior to and discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option of reporting the behavior to the [Office of the Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/). See also [Purdue University Bill of Student Rights](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights).

## Academic Integrity
The instructor fully expects all students to follow [Purdue’s Honor Pledge](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/honor-pledge/about.html): “As a boilermaker pursuing academic excellence, I pledge to be honest and true in all that I do. Accountable together - we are Purdue."

integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breaches of this value by either emailing integrity@purdue.edu or by calling (765) 494-8778. While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information is submitted the greater the opportunity for the university to investigate the concern. More details are available on our course Brightspace table of contents, under University Policies.
