= Mentor & TA Feedback 

Mentor and TA feedback is provided twice a semester: after 8 weeks and at the end of the semester. TAs and Mentors should collaborate on the feedback for each student on the team. We recommend the TA and Mentor schedule a meeting to discuss and put the feedback into Gradescope. Only the TA has access to Gradescope, but they should share their screen on the call with the Mentor.

*Spring 2022 Dates*

* End of 8 weeks: Sunday, March 6, 2022
* *Mid-semester feedback due Sunday, March 13, 2022*
* Last day of semester: Sunday, May 1, 2022

== How to Provide Constructive Feedback

=== Tips 

* Use examples and observations in your feedback. Do not make assumptions. 
* Focus your feedback on areas the student can control and improve on (as opposed to identifying problems out of the student's control).
* Share recommendations and solutions for the problem you identify.
* Watch this 5-minute TED talk titled link:https://www.ted.com/talks/leeann_renninger_the_secret_to_giving_great_feedback?language=en["The secret to giving great feedback"]

=== Examples of Bad Constructive Feedback

* "You need to do better."
* "You need to talk more."


=== Examples of Good Constructive Feedback

* "You are reserved during team meetings, but we would value your insights. We encourage you to unmute and share your ideas more often. "
