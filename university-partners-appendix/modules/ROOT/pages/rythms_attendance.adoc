== FAQ
*When should TAs take attendance?*

TAs should take attendance at every team meeting and lab during the semester. 

*Should TAs account for tardiness to meetings?*

Team members are expected to be on time to team meetings and labs. However, if a team member is tardy to a team meeting with a valid reason, then it is okay to provide leeway. If tardiness does persist without reason, then talking with the team member to realign expectations may be necessary.

*When should a student notify their TA if they are going to be absent from a meeting?*

Students should communicate with their TA 24 hours in advance of the team meeting to get approval to miss the meeting. If the situation is an emergency, any communication prior to the meeting is okay. 

*What are acceptable reasons for absence from team meetings?*

Team members can request to be excused from team meetings on a case-by-case basis. University-sponsored activities, religious observations, sickness, and emergencies are excusable.
