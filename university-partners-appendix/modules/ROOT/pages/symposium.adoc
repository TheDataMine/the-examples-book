== Symposium: Wednesday, April 20, 2022

=== Poster and Video Viewing
The posters and videos will be available link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome.html[on this website] starting at 8:00 AM (EST) on Wednesday April 20th, 2022 (the 2022 website link has not yet been posted).  The event is open to the public, all of The Data Mine’s Corporate Partners, students and their family and friends are welcome to attend.  

 
=== Q&A and Discussion

From 2:30 - 4:30 PM Eastern time on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, each poster group will have a 
Zoom link so that other students and corporate partner guests can join and ask questions/discuss. For example, there will be a Ford Zoom link, a Viasat Zoom link, etc. 

=== Dress Code
Students should dress in business casual attire and have a professional background (or virtual filter) for the online Q&A/discussion portion. Review the xref:student_code_of_conduct.adoc[student code of conduct for online meeting "net-etiquette" and dress code information.] 


== Deliverables 

* _[Per Team]_ One 3 x 4 feet *poster* submitted as a PDF. 
** Subteams should work together to make one poster. 
** _It is imperative that you work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared._
* _[Per Team]_ One 5-8 minute long *video*   
** The video doesn’t have to include everything you did all year long, but it should discuss the motivation for the project, any necessary background (keep it brief), and your results. _Think of this as a “movie trailer” or “elevator pitch” for your Q&A and discussion._
** If you developed something interactive (Shiny app), you should either demonstrate it to the end of your PowerPoint video or create a separate (short) demo video for the app.  
* _[Individual - all students]_ *Participation* 
Wednesday April 20, 2022 from 2:30 - 4:30 PM (ET) there is a zoom link for each of the projects for a live discussion/Q&A session. Each student is required to be present for at least 1 hour (out of the 2 hour period). The virtual room must be staffed with team members for the entirety of the 2 hours. How your team divides that time is up to you. The Data Mine encourages attending both hours if possible. The Symposium was many student’s favorite part of last year.  

=== Expectations

* *All students must contribute to the poster and video, but likely in different roles.*
* Here are some examples of different roles the students can fill(as well as added suggestions): 

** One student can take the poster content and translate it to PowerPoint slides. It is recommended that you add more visuals to your slides and please do not make them text heavy.  
** One student can write the script for the video. Make sure to practice reading it to ensure it fits within the required time. 
** One student can create the recording and voice over 
** One student can do any necessary editing and add the closed captions.  
* *Work closely with your Corporate Partner Mentor to identify what parts of the project can be publicly shared*. The Data Mine will send all posters to review the company's legal team before posting for the Symposium. 

=== Due Dates

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Drafts* of the poster and video due *Sunday, March 13, 2022*. 

*Final versions* of the poster and video due *Sunday, April 3, 2022*.

====

A submitted poster draft should be at least 75% complete. Any sections without content/visuals should contain notes of what will be added. 

A submitted video draft includes slides, script, and a completed initial recording. Captioning is not required for the draft.

=== Examples
The Data Mine had a virtual symposium in 2020 and 2021. Please note we had fewer Corporate Partner teams in 2020 & 2021.  It would be helpful to watch some of the videos and review the posters from link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome2020.html[2019-2020] and link:https://datamine.purdue.edu/symposium/welcome.html[2020-2021].

=== Step 1: Create your poster

* A SharePoint link will be sent to your team with a Purdue template. Use this link to create your poster so we can easily access it. Your team is welcome to update the template to match a template from your company. In fact, we encourage you to use the poster theme from your Corporate Partner. 
* *Your poster should not be text heavy* -- it is not a paper, so complete sentences should be limited. Make sure to include multiple visuals and keep sentences to a minimum. Bullet points are encouraged.  
* Note: you will not need to print your poster. The Data Mine will handle the printing of your poster.  
* Make sure to include all of these categories:

[cols="3,5"]
|===

|*Introduction/Background/Motivation* |• We recommend looking back at the project description and materials shared during the first weeks of the fall semester. This will be a great resource to find introduction and background material and wording.
|*Research Methodology* |• The “how” of your research
|*Conclusions* |• What are your big picture findings? 
|*Future Goals* | • What are next steps if you had more time to continue? 
|*References & Acknowledgements* | • Thank your CRP Mentors, any faculty mentors, and others that helped on the project.

• Cite your sources! There may be too many to include, but list a few
*key* sources. 
|*Figures* | • Make sure to include relevant visuals
|*Layout & Design* | • Keep font and colors consistent.

• Make sure it is visually appealing. Zoom out and make the entire poster shows on your screen. What do you notice about it? Is it full of text? Too much white space? Not enough images? Flow is confusing?

=== Step 2: Transfer your poster content to slides

* *Take the same content (words and visuals) from your finished poster and transfer them to PowerPoint slides.*
* The slides don’t have to match up word for word as the poster, but do not feel that you need to create new content. If anything, your slides will be briefer than your poster. *Make sure your slides tell a story.*
* Make sure each slide isn’t too text heavy. *Add a relevant visual on every slide if possible.*
* Allow time at the end of your slides for any interactive visualizations you plan to show. You can also make a separate video for your app demonstrations. 

=== Step 3: Make a transcript for your recording
* It is strongly recommended that you make a transcript for your video.
* Practice reading your transcript as you write it so it falls within the required time frame. For example, you could write your script in the “Notes” box under each slide. 


image::symposium_powerpoint_transcript.jpg[Our image, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Screenshot of adding notes for the transcript in PowerPoint."] 

* This will make future recordings as consistent as possible. After, the legal review and draft, you may need
to record your video again.
* It is easier to add closed captioning with a transcript. 

=== Step 4: Record your video

There are a variety of ways to create your video recording. Here are some options:

* Record link:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c[audio for each slide] and link:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83[export the PowerPoint as a video].
** This works exceptionally well and is very simple. If you have an app demonstration, you
can use a screen recording tool above to make two separate videos (PowerPoint and
demo) or stitch them together in an editor.
* Record your entire screen or selected portion of your screen link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721[on your Mac].
* Record your screen in link:https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-capture-video-clips-in-windows-10[Windows 10].
* Record using link:https://obsproject.com/[OBS Studio] which is free for Windows, Mac, and Linux
* Record using link:https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder?__c=1[Apowersoft] which is an in-browser tool for free
* Record your screen on your link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935[iPad].
* [_Only recommended if multiple people will be talking in the video and option 1 above does not seem to work_] Share your screen and record in Zoom.  https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/

=== Step 5: Edit your video 

* This step is optional. Edit your video on an as-needed basis.
* This could mean putting two audio recordings into one video or cropping out a mistake.

* link:https://www.shotcut.org/[Shotcut] is free for Mac/Windows/Linux

=== Step 6: Upload your video 


1.  Go to youtube.com and click on the *Camera > Upload Video*. You have to be signed into your account.

2. Upload your video. There are link:https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en[lots of tutorials online] on how to upload a video to YouTube. *The most important part is to make your video Unlisted so it is not searchable.*

=== Step 7: Add ADA Closed Captions

* You are required to add closed captioning to your video on YouTube. 
* CC’s should be added to the draft and final video
* YouTube will automatically generate Closed Captions which makes this step easy. However, you MUST edit them for punctuation, capitalization, and any spelling or interpretation errors. 
* This link:https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/videos/youtube/[link] is a great resource with tutorials on how to add and edit automatic captions on YouTube. 
* Below is an example of the auto captions that were generated for a test video. Click _Edit_ to add punctuation and make changes.  

image::symposium_CC.jpg[Our image, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Screenshot of editing auto captions in YouTube."]


==== ADA Closed Caption Guidelines

* Include no more than 32 characters per line.
* One to three lines of text appear onscreen, display for three to seven seconds, and then are replaced by the next caption.
* Captions are available throughout the entire video, even when there is no speaking.
* Time captions to synchronize with the audio.
* Require the use of upper and lowercase letters.
* Use a font similar to Helvetica medium.
* Captions should be accessible and readily available to those who need or want them.
* Captions should appear onscreen long enough to be read.
* Speakers should be identified when more than one person is onscreen or when the speaker is not visible.
* Spelling is correct.
* Words should be verbatim when time allows or as close as possible in other situations.
* All words are captioned, regardless of language or dialect.
* Punctuation is used to clarify meaning.
* Add music or other descriptions inside brackets such as [music] or [laughter].
* Indicate when no narration is present and describe any relevant sound effects.
* Use of slang and accent is preserved and identified.
