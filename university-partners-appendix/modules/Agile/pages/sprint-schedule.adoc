= Sprint Schedule in The Data Mine

Because The Data Mine Corporate Partners experience is on an academic schedule, the typical sprint schedule used in industry must be modified. Here is an example of a sprint schedule in The Data Mine:

*Monday/Tuesday Meeting*: sprint planning meeting with corporate partner mentor

*Thursday/Friday Lab*: standup and working meeting

*Following Monday/Tuesday Meeting*: sprint review meeting with corporate partner mentor

*Following Thursday/Friday Lab*: standup, sprint retrospective, and working meeting

[IMPORTANT]
====
This schedule can be modified slightly, but it is most important for sprint planning meetings and sprint review meetings to be held with corporate partner mentors.
