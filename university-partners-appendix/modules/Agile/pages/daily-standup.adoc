= Daily Standups

During the duration of the sprint, teams will hold a daily ceremonie called *daily standups*. These short meetings should last no longer than 15 minutes and are simply a check in point each day for the team. Each person on the team will speak for a couple minutes, answering these questions:

1.	What did I do yesterday?
2.	What will I do today?
3.	Do I have any blockers?

Daily standups keep each team member accountable for their progress and allows for discussion of any blockers as well. 


== Daily Standups in The Data Mine

It is not feasible to have daily standups in The Data Mine model because teams are constrained by an academic schedule. However, it is possible to hold similar events on a weekly basis. Once a week, teams should start their meetings with a “weekly” standup following the same format of a daily standup. 

[Tip]
====
Keep these meetings lighthearted and fun. The more stress placed on team members for these quick check-ins makes standups less valuable.
